%% 20. Ballfun 
% Nicolas Boulle and Alex Townsend, November 2018

%% 20.1 Introduction
% Ballfun is a new part of Chebfun for computing with scalar and vector functions 
% defined on the unit ball. It is an extension of Spherefun [5] and Diskfun 
% [6] to three dimensions and like them contains dozens of functions to perform 
% basic operations between functions and vectors such as differentiation, 
% integration, Helmholtz decomposition, poloidal-toroidal decomposition, and 
% many others. It was created by Nicolas Boulle and Alex Townsend [3].

%%
% A function $f$ on the unit ball can be expressed in cartesian coordinates
% $f(x,y,z)$, where $x^2+y^2+z^2\leq 1$. For example, the function $f(x,y,z) = \cos(xy)$
% can be constructed in Ballfun by the following command
f = ballfun(@(x,y,z) cos(x.*y));
plot( f )

%%
% Ballfun also allows functions to be supplied to the constructor in spherical
% coordinates $f(r,\lambda,\theta)$, where $r$ is the radial variable,
% $\lambda$ is the azimuthal angle between $-\pi$ and $\pi$ and
% $\theta\in[0,\pi]$ is the polar angle.
g = ballfun(@(r,lam,th) cos(r.^2.*cos(lam).*sin(lam).*sin(th).^2), 'spherical');

%%
% The resulting objects are identical up to machine precision:
norm( f - g )

%%
% We call the resulting representations ballfuns:
f

%%
% The output displays the discretization size employed to represent the function in
% a Chebyshev-Fourier-Fourier expansion. The numbers $21$, $41$, and $37$ indicate
% that the ballfun is represented by a $21\times 41\times 37$ tensor of coefficients.

%% 20.2 Visualizing ballfuns
% There are plenty of ways to visualize a ballfun object. The simplest is 
% the |plot| command:
plot( f )

%%
% Slices of the ballfun along the planes $x=0$, $y=0$ or $z=0$ passing through
% the origin can also be obtained, taking the form of diskfuns:
fdisk = f(:, :, 0);
plot( fdisk )

%%
% Moreover, the restriction to the unit sphere can be obtained with the 
% following command, returning a spherefun:
fsphere = f(1, :, :, 'spherical')
plot( fsphere )

%% 20.3 Basic operations
% Nearly a hundred commands have been overloaded to allow users to visualize,
% manipulate, and compute with ballfuns. We detail a few of the basic commands
% below.

%%
% For example, basic algebra such as addition, subtraction, and
% multiplication are given by the operations '+', '-', and '.*':
f = ballfun(@(x,y,z) sin(x.^2+z.^2)+cos(y).^2);
g = ballfun(@(x,y,z) cos((x.*z).^2));

subplot(2,2,1)
plot( f ), title( 'f' )
subplot(2,2,2)
plot( g ), title( 'g' )
subplot(2,2,3)
plot( f + g ), title( 'f + g' )
subplot(2,2,4)
plot( f .* g ), title( 'f .* g' )

%%
% The definite triple integral of a ballfun is computed via the |sum3| command. 
% For example, the integral of $f(x,y,z)=1$ over the unit ball is $4\pi/3$.
f = ballfun(@(x,y,z)1);
intf = sum3(f)
error = intf - 4*pi/3

%%
% Ballfun offers the |sum| command for integrating over the variable $r$,
% $\lambda$ or $\theta$, returning a spherefun or a diskfun. The following
% code computes
%
% $$s(\lambda,\theta) = \int_0^1f(r,\lambda,\theta)r^2dr$$
%
% and returns a spherefun.
f = ballfun(@(x,y,z) x.^2);
sumf = sum(f, 1)
clf, plot( sumf )

%%
sumf = sum(f, 2)
plot( sumf )

%%
% Similarly, the |sum2| command integrates functions over two of the three
% variables:
%
% $$s(\lambda) = \int_0^\pi\int_0^1f(r,\lambda,\theta)r^2\sin(\theta)drd\theta,$$
f = ballfun(@(x,y,z) y);
sum2f = sum2(f, [1, 3])
plot( sum2f )

%%
% Ballfun has a fast |rotate| command to efficiently rotate functions.
f = ballfun(@(x,y,z) sin(50*z) - x.^2);
g = rotate(f, -pi/4, pi/2, pi/8);
subplot(1,2,1)
plot( f ), title('Original')
subplot(1,2,2)
plot( g ), title('Rotated')

%%
% Differentiation on the ball with respect to spherical coordinates in $r$,
% $\lambda$ and $\theta$ may introduce singularities. For instance, consider 
% the smooth function $f(r,\lambda,\theta) = r\cos\theta$. The derivative of 
% $f$ with respect to $\theta$ is $-r\sin\theta$, which is not smooth along 
% the axis $x=y=0$. However, we are interested in computing derivatives that
% arise in vector calculus such as the gradient, the divergence, the curl or the
% Laplacian. Then, these operations can be written in cartesian coordinates 
% with partial derivatives with respect to $x$, $y$ and $z$ and are smooth.
% We follow a similar approach to Spherefun and express the partial derivatives
% in $x$, $y$, $z$ in terms of the spherical coordinates $r$, $\lambda$ and
% $\theta$. These operations are implemented in Ballfun in the |diff|
% command. For example, the partial derivative of $f(x,y,z) = \cos(xy)$ can 
% be computed by
f = ballfun(@(x,y,z) cos(x.*y));
g = diff(f, 1);
exact = ballfun(@(x,y,z) -y.*sin(x.*y));

norm(g-exact)
clf, plot( g ), title('df/dx')

%% 
% The Laplacian is computed in Cartesian coordinates using the |laplacian|
% command:
%
% $$\Delta f = \frac{\partial^2f}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2f}{\partial y^2}+\frac{\partial^2f}{\partial z^2}.$$
f = ballfun(@(x,y,z) cos(x.*y)+sin(z));
subplot(1,2,1)
plot( f ), title('f')
subplot(1,2,2)
plot( laplacian(f) ), title('laplacian( f )')

%% 20.4 Helmholtz solver
% Ballfun has a command for solving the Helmholtz equation on the ball with 
% Dirichlet boundary conditions. For example, to solve
%
% $$\nabla^2u + 2u = f,\quad u|_{\partial B} = 1,$$
%
% where $f(x,y,z) = -2(2x^2\cos(x^2)+\sin(x^2))+4\cos(x^2)$, one can execute
% these commands:
f = ballfun(@(x,y,z) -2*(2*x.^2.*cos(x.^2) + sin(x.^2)) + 4*cos(x.^2));
bc = @(lam, th) cos(sin(th).^2.*cos(lam).^2);
u = helmholtz(f, 2, bc, 45, 45, 45);
exact = ballfun(@(x,y,z) cos(x.^2));
norm(u-exact)

clf, plot( u )

%%
% It is also possible to solve Helmholtz's equation with Neumann boundary 
% conditions
%
% $$\nabla^2u + Ku = f,\quad \left.\frac{\partial u}{\partial r}\right|_{\partial B} = bc(\lambda,\theta):$$
exact = ballfun(@(x,y,z) sin(y.^2));
f = ballfun(@(x,y,z) 2*cos(y.^2)-4*y.^2.*sin(y.^2));
bc = @(lam,th) 2*(sin(th).*sin(lam)).^2.*cos((sin(th).*sin(lam)).^2);
u = helmholtz(f, 0, bc, 50, 50, 50, 'neumann');

plot( u )

%%
% We then check if our two solutions differ by at most a constant (the kernel
% of the Helmholtz equation with Neumann boundary conditions):
max( [ norm(diff(u, 1)-diff(exact, 1)), norm(diff(u, 2)-diff(exact, 2)), ...
                                        norm(diff(u, 3)-diff(exact, 3)) ] )
                             
%% 20.5 Solid harmonics
% Solid harmonics appear as solutions of the Laplace equation. They are
% defined as
%
% $$R^m_l(\lambda,\theta) = \sqrt{2l+3}r^lY^m_l(\lambda,\theta) = \sqrt{2l+3}r^lP^m_l(\theta)e^{im\lambda},$$
%
% where $P^m_l$  is an associated Legendre polynomial, and they satisfy
%
% $$\int_B R^m_l R^{m^*}_ldV = 1,\quad \forall l\in\bf{N},\quad \forall -l\leq m\leq l.$$
%
% Ballfun provides a method for constructing them. For example, the solid 
% harmonic $R^m_l$ of degree $l=4$ and order $m=-2$ is constructed as:
R = ballfun.solharm(4, -2);
plot( R ), title('R_4^{-2}')

%%
% We can verify that this function is a solution of the Laplace equation
% $\Delta f = 0$:
norm( laplacian( R ) )

%%
% We can also verify the orthonormality of the solid harmonics on the ball
% using the |sum3| command
R40 = ballfun.solharm(4, 0);
sum3(R.*conj(R))
sum3(R40.*conj(R40))
sum3(R.*conj(R40))

%%
% Here is a plot of the first few solid harmonics $R^m_l$, with $l=0,...,3$ and
% $0\leq m\leq l$.
for l = 0:3
    for m = 0:l
        Y = ballfun.solharm(l, m);
        subplot(4,4,4*l+m+1), plot(Y)
        axis off
    end
end

%% 20.6 Vector calculus with Ballfunv
% Vector fields in Ballfun are implemented in the Cartesian system
% $(\mathbf{e}_x,\mathbf{e}_y,\mathbf{e}_z)$, where $\mathbf{e}_x$ denotes
% the unit vector in the $x$ direction. In fact, a vector field expressed 
% in the spherical system $(\mathbf{e}_r,\mathbf{e}_\lambda,\mathbf{e}_\theta)$
% is not always smooth in the unit ball, so it is more convenient to use
% Cartesian coordinates. For example, the vector field
% $v(x,y,z) = (\sin(x),xy,\cos(z))$ can be constructed as follows in
% Ballfun:
Vx = ballfun(@(x,y,z) x.*y);
Vy = ballfun(@(x,y,z) sin(x.*z));
Vz = ballfun(@(x,y,z) sin(y));
V = ballfunv(Vx, Vy, Vz)

clf, quiver( V ), title('V')

%%
% Each component is represented as a ballfun and singularities are avoided
% because the components are in the directions of $\mathbf{e}_x$, $\mathbf{e}_y$, and
% $\mathbf{e}_z$, respectively.

%%
% The main operations for vector-valued functions are supported in Ballfun.
% These include the curl and the divergence, among others.
W = curl(V);
quiver(W), title('curl( V )')

f = divergence(V);
plot(f), title('divergence( V )')

%% 
% One can easily check that the vector calculus identities are satisfied. 
% For example, the curl of a gradient field is zero:
%
% $$\nabla\times(\nabla f) = 0$$
f = ballfun(@(x,y,z) cos(x.*z));
V = curl( grad( f ) );
norm( V )

%%
% The divergence of the curl is also zero:
f = norm( divergence( curl( V ) ) );
norm( f )

%% 20.7 Poloidal-toroidal decomposition
% In vector calculus, the poloidal-toroidal (PT) decomposition [1] is a 
% restricted form of the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition [4]. The idea is that 
% any sufficiently smooth and divergence-free vector field in the ball can 
% be expressed as the sum of a poloidal field and a toroidal field. The PT 
% decomposition used in the analysis of divergence-free vector fields in 
% geomagnetism, flow visualization, and incompressible fluid simulations.
%
% For a chosen unit vector $\mathbf{e}_r$, a toroidal field, $\mathbf{T}$, is
% one that is tangential to $\mathbf{e}_r$ while a poloidal field, $\mathbf{P}$,
% is one whose curl is tangential to $\mathbf{e}_r$, i.e.,
%
% $$ \mathbf{e}_r\cdot \mathbf{T} = 0, \quad \mathbf{e}_r\cdot (\nabla \times \mathbf{P}) = 0.$$
%
% Let $w$ be any divergence-free vector field defined in the unit ball. The
% PT decomposition is the representation of $w$ as the following sum:
%
% $$ w = \nabla\times\nabla\times(\bf{r}P_w) + \nabla\times(\bf{r}T_w),$$
% 
% where $\bf{r} = r\bf{e}_r$, and $P_w$ and $T_w$ are scalar-valued potential
% functions (called the poloidal and toroidal scalars). In this setting, the natural unit vector,
% $\bf{e}_r$ to select is the unit radial vector that points away from
% the origin. The scalars $P_w$ and $T_w$ are unique up to the addition of 
% an arbitrary function that only depends on the radial variable, $r$.
%
% To illustrate the decomposition, we take the divergence-free vector field
% $v = \nabla\times\nabla\times(\bf{r}P_w) + \nabla\times(\bf{r}T_w)$:
Pw = ballfun(@(x,y,z) cos(x.*y));
Tw = ballfun(@(x,y,z) sin(y.*z));
w = ballfunv.PT2ballfunv(Pw, Tw);
quiver( w )

%%
% We start by checking that $v$ is a divergence-free vector field:
norm( div( w ) )

%%
% The poloidal-toroidal decomposition of $v$ can be computed as follows:
[Pw, Tw] = PTdecomposition( w );
subplot(1,2,1)
plot(Pw), title('Poloidal scalar')
subplot(1,2,2)
plot(Tw), title('Toroidal scalar')

%%
% Here is a visualization of the decomposition.
[P,T] = ballfunv.PT2ballfunv(Pw, Tw);
subplot(1,3,1) 
quiver( w ), title('Divergence-free vector field')
subplot(1,3,2)
quiver( P ), title('Poloidal component')
subplot(1,3,3)
quiver( T ), title('Toroidal component')

%% 
% The original vector field can be recovered from the poloidal and toroidal
% scalars since
%
% $$ w = \nabla\times\nabla\times(\bf{r}P_w) + \nabla\times(\bf{r}T_w).$$
%
% This operation is implemented in Ballfun in the |PT2ballfunv| command
v = ballfunv.PT2ballfunv(Pw, Tw);
norm( w - v ) 

%% 20.8 Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition
% In vector calculus, Helmholtz's theorem states that any sufficiently 
% smooth vector field in the ball can be expressed as a sum of a curl-free,
% a divergence-free, and an harmonic vector field [4].
%
% Let $v$ be a vector field defined in the ball of radius $1$. Helmholtz's
% theorem says that we can decompose $v$ as follows: 
%
% $$ \mathbf{v} = \nabla f + \nabla \times \psi + \nabla\phi,$$
%
% where $f$ and $\phi$ are scalar-valued potential functions and $\psi$ is 
% a vector field. The first term, $\nabla f$, is a gradient field and hence
% curl-free, while the second term, $\nabla \times \psi$, is divergence-free. 
% The third term is an harmonic vector field (vector Laplacian of $\nabla \phi$
% is zero). From vector identities, one knows that the scalar field, $\phi$,
% is itself harmonic, i.e., $\Delta \phi = 0$.
%
% The Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition can be made unique by imposing 
% additional constraints on $f$ and $\psi$ [4]. The standard constraints are: 
% (1) $f$ is zero on the boundary of the unit ball, (2) the normal
% component of $\psi$ on the boundary is zero, and (3) $\psi$ is 
% divergence-free.
%
% The Helmholtz-Hogde decomposition is an important tool in fluid dynamics, 
% as it is used for flow visualization (when the fluid is compressible), in 
% CFD simulations (to impose the condition that a fluid remains incompressible),
% and topological analysis. A survey of applications is available here [2].
%
% We start with the following vector field:
v = ballfunv(@(x,y,z) cos(x.*y).*z,@(x,y,z)sin(x.*z),@(x,y,z)y.*z);
clf, quiver( v )

%%
% Ballfun has a command |HelmholtzDecomposition| that computes the 
% Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition of a vector field. In the command lines
% below, $P_\psi$ and $T_\psi$ stand for the poloidal and toroidal scalars
% of the divergence-free vector field $\psi$.
[f, Ppsi, Tpsi, phi] = HelmholtzDecomposition( v );

%% 
% The curl-free component is equal to $\nabla f$:
quiver( grad( f ) ), title('Curl-free component of v')

%% 
% We confirm that this component is curl-free: 
norm( curl( grad( f ) ) )

%% 
% We plot the harmonic component of $v$ below
quiver( grad( phi ) ), title('Harmonic component of v')

%%
% We check the harmonicity of this component: 
norm( laplacian( grad( phi ) ) ) 

%%
% The divergence-free component $\psi$ can be computed from its poloidal 
% and toroidal scalars:
psi = ballfunv.PT2ballfunv(Ppsi, Tpsi);
quiver( curl( psi ) ), title('Divergence-free component of v')

%% 
% By vector identities this component is divergence-free: 
norm( div( curl( psi ) ) ) 

%%
% Here is a plot of each component of the decomposition. 
subplot(1,4,1) 
quiver( v ), title('Vector field')
subplot(1,4,2)
quiver( grad(f) ), title('Curl-free')
subplot(1,4,3)
quiver( curl(psi) ), title('Divergence-free')
subplot(1,4,4)
quiver( grad(phi) ), title('Harmonic')

%% 
% As a sanity check we confirm that the decomposition has been successful:
w = grad( f ) + curl( psi ) + grad( phi );
norm( v - w )
