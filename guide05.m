%% 5.1  Complex functions of a real variable
% (See also Section 12.7 -- phase portraits in Chebfun2.)

%%
% One of the attractive features of MATLAB is that it handles complex
% arithmetic well. For example, here are $20$ points on the upper half of the
% unit circle in the complex plane:
MS = 'markersize';
s = linspace(0,pi,20);
f = exp(1i*s);
plot(f,'.',MS,10)
axis equal
  
%%
% In MATLAB, both the variables |i| and |j| are initialized as $i$, the square
% root of $-1$, but this code uses |1i| instead (just as one might write, for
% example, |3+2i| or |2.2-1.1i|).  Writing the imaginary unit in this fashion
% is a common trick among MATLAB programmers, for it avoids the risk of
% surprises caused by |i| or |j| having been overwritten by other values. The
% |axis equal| command ensures that the real and imaginary axes are scaled
% equally.

%%
% Here is a Chebfun analogue.
s = chebfun(@(s) s,[0 pi]);
f = exp(1i*s);
plot(f)
axis equal

%%
% The Chebfun semicircle is represented by a polynomial of low degree:
length(f)
plot(f,'.-',MS,10)
axis equal

%%
% We can have fun with variations on the theme:
subplot(1,2,1), g = s*exp(10i*s); plot(g), axis equal
subplot(1,2,2), h = exp(2i*s)+.3*exp(20i*s); plot(h), axis equal

%%
subplot(1,2,1), plot(g^2), axis equal
subplot(1,2,2), plot(exp(h)), axis equal

%%
% Such plots make pretty pictures, but as always with Chebfun, the
% underlying operations involve precise mathematics carried out to many
% digits of accuracy.  For example, the integral of |g| is $-\pi i/10$,
sum(g)

%%
% and the integral of |h| is zero:
sum(h)

%%
% Piecewise smooth complex chebfuns are also possible. For example, the
% following starts from a chebfun |z| defined as $(1+0.5i)s$ for $s$ on the
% interval $[0,1]$ and $1+0.5i-2(s-1)$ for $s$ on the interval $[1,2]$.
z = chebfun({@(s) (1+.5i)*s, @(s) 1+.5i-2*(s-1)},[0 1 2]);
subplot(1,2,1), plot(z), axis equal, grid on
subplot(1,2,2), plot(z^2), axis equal, grid on

%%
% Actually, this way of constructing a piecewise chebfun is rather clumsy.
% An easier method is to use the |join| command, in which a
% construction like |join(f,g,h)| constructs a single chebfun with the same
% values as |f|, |g|, and |h|, but on a domain concatenated together.  Thus if
% the domains of |f|, |g|, |h| are $[a,b]$,
% $[c,d]$, and $[e,f]$, then |join(f,g,h)| has
% three pieces with domains $[a,b]$, $[b,b+(d-c)]$, $[b+(d-c),b+(d-c)+(f-e)]$.
% Using this trick, we can construct the chebfun |z| above in the following
% alternative manner:
  s = chebfun(@(s) s,[0 1]);
  zz = join((1+.5i)*s, 1+.5i-2*s);
  norm(z-zz)

%% 5.2 Analytic functions and conformal maps
% A function is *analytic* if it is differentiable in the complex sense, or
% equivalently, if it has a convergent Taylor series near each point in
% its domain of definition.
% Analytic functions do interesting things in the complex plane. In
% particular, away from points where the derivative is zero, they are
% *conformal maps*, which means that although they may scale and rotate an
% infinitesimal region, they preserve angles between intersecting curves.

%%
% For example, suppose we define |R| to be a chebfun corresponding to the
% four sides of a rectangle and we define |X| to be another chebfun
% corresponding to a cross inside |R|.
s = chebfun('s',[0 1]);
R = join(1+s, 2+2i*s, 2+2i-s, 1+2i-2i*s);
LW = 'linewidth'; lw1 = 1.5; lw2 = 2.2;
clf, subplot(1,2,1), plot(R,LW,lw2), grid on, axis equal
X = join(1.3+1.5i+.4*s, 1.5+1.3i+.4i*s);
hold on, plot(X,'r',LW,lw2)

%%
% Here we see what happens to |R| and |X| under the maps $z^2$ and $\exp(z)$:
clf
subplot(1,2,1), plot(R^2,LW,lw1), grid on, axis equal
hold on, plot(X^2,'r',LW,lw2)
subplot(1,2,2), plot(exp(R),LW,lw1), grid on, axis equal
hold on, plot(exp(X),'r',LW,lw2)

%%
% We can take the same idea further and construct a grid in the complex
% plane, each segment of which is a piece of a chebfun that happens to be
% linear.  In this case we accumulate the various pieces as successive
% columns of a quasimatrix, i.e., a "matrix" whose columns are chebfuns
% (see Chapter 6).
  x = chebfun(@(x) x);
  S = chebfun;                  % make an empty chebfun
  for d = -1:.2:1
    S = [S d+1i*x 1i*d+x];      % add 2 more lines to the collection
  end
  clf,
  subplot(1,2,1), plot(S), axis equal

%%
% Here are the exponential and tangent of the grid:
  subplot(1,2,1), plot(exp(S)), axis equal
  subplot(1,2,2), plot(tan(S)), axis equal

%%
% Here is a sequence that puts all three images together on a single scale:
  clf
  plot(S), hold on
  plot(1.6+exp(S))
  plot(6.6+tan(S))
  axis equal, axis off

%%
% A particularly interesting set of conformal maps are the *Moebius
% transformations*, the rational functions of the form $(az+b)/(cz+d)$ for
% constants $a,b,c,d$.  For example, here is a square and its image under the
% map $w = 1/(1+z)$, and the image of the image under the same map, and the
% image of the image of the image.  We also plot the limit point given by
% the equation $z = 1/(1+z)$, i.e., $z = (\sqrt{5}-1)/2$.
moebius = @(z) 1/(1+z);
s = chebfun(@(s) s,[0 1]);
S = join(-.5i+s, 1-.5i+1i*s, 1+.5i-s, .5i-1i*s);
clf
for j = 1:3
  S = [S moebius(S(:,j))];
end
plot(S)
hold on, axis equal
plot((sqrt(5)-1)/2,0,'.k',MS,6)

%%
% Here's a prettier version of the same image using the Chebfun |fill|
% command.
S = join(-.5i+s, 1-.5i+1i*s, 1+.5i-s, .5i-1i*s);
clf
fill(real(S),imag(S),[.5 .5 1]), axis equal, hold on
S = moebius(S); fill(real(S),imag(S),[.5 1 .5])
S = moebius(S); fill(real(S),imag(S),[1 .5 .5])
S = moebius(S); fill(real(S),imag(S),[.5 1 1 ])
plot((sqrt(5)-1)/2,0,'.k',MS,6)
axis off

%% 5.3 Contour integrals
% If $s$ is a real parameter and $z(s)$ is a complex function of $s$,
% then we can define a contour integral in the complex plane like this:
% $$ \int f(z(s)) z'(s) ds . $$
% The contour in question is the curve described by $z(s)$ as $s$ varies over
% its range.

%%
% For example, in the example at the end of Section 5.1 the contour
% consists of two straight segments that begin at $0$ and end at $-1+.5i$.  We
% can compute the integral of $\exp(-z^2)$ over the contour like this:
  f = exp(-z^2);
  I = sum(f*diff(z))

%%
% Notice how easily the contour integral is realized in Chebfun, even over
% a contour consisting of several pieces. This particular integral is
% related to the complex error function [Weideman 1994].
  
%%
% According to *Cauchy's theorem*, the integral of an analytic function
% around a closed curve is zero, or equivalently, the integral between two
% points $z_1$ and $z_2$ is path-independent.
% To verify this property, we can compute the
% same integral over the straight segment going directly from $0$
% to $-1+0.5i$:
  w = chebfun('(-1+.5i)*s',[0 1]);
  f = exp(-w^2);
  I2 = sum(f*diff(w))

%%
% A *meromorphic function* is a function that is analytic in a region of
% interest in the complex plane apart from possible poles. According to the
% *Cauchy integral formula*, $1/2\pi i$ times the integral of a meromorphic
% function $f$ around a closed contour is equal to the sum of the residues of
% $f$ associated with any poles it may have in the enclosed region.   The
% *residue* of $f$ at a point $z_0$ is the coefficient of the degree $-1$ term in
% its Laurent expansion at $z_0$.  For example, the function
% $\exp(z)/z^3$ has
% Laurent series $z^{-3} + z^{-2} + (1/2)z^{-1} + (1/6)z^0 +\dots$ at the
% origin, and so its residue there is $1/2$.  We can confirm this by
% computing the contour integral around a circle:
z = chebfun('exp(1i*s)',[0 2*pi]);
f = exp(z)/z^3;
I = sum(f*diff(z))/(2i*pi)

%%
% Notice that we have just computed the degree $2$ Taylor coefficient of $\exp(z)$.

%%
% When Chebfun integrates around a circular contour like this, it does not
% automatically take advantage of the fact that the integrand is periodic.
% That would
% be Fourier analysis as opposed to Chebyshev analysis, and beginning
% with Version 5, a "trigfun" approach to such problems has been
% available, at least when the arguments are smooth (compare [Davis 1959]).
% For example, we could repeat the above calculation in Fourier mode
% like this:
z = chebfun('exp(1i*s)',[0 2*pi],'trig');
f = exp(z)/z^3;
I = sum(f*diff(z))/(2i*pi)

%%
% Chebyshev methods are more flexible, as a rule, but Fourier methods
% have advantages sometimes of efficiency (up to a factor of $\pi/2$
% per dimension) and accuracy.  For techniques that recover some of
% that factor of $\pi/2$ even for nonperiodic problems,
% see [Hale & Trefethen 2008].

%%
% The contour does not have to have radius $1$, or be centered at the origin:
z = chebfun('1+2*exp(1i*s)',[0 2*pi],'trig');
f = exp(z)/z^3;
I2 = sum(f*diff(z))/(2i*pi)

%% 
% Nor does the contour have to be smooth. Here let us compute the same
% result by integration over a square (reverting to Chebyshev rather
% than Fourier technology).
s = chebfun('s',[-1 1]);
z = join(1+1i*s, 1i-s, -1-1i*s, -1i+s);
f = exp(z)/z^3;
I3 = sum(f*diff(z))/(2i*pi)

%%
% In Chebfun one can also construct more interesting contours of the kind
% that appear in complex variables texts.  Here is an example involving
% a "keyhole" contour:
  c = [-2+.05i, -.2+.05i, -.2-.05i, -2-.05i];    % 4 corners
  s = chebfun('s',[0 1]);
  z = join(c(1)+s*(c(2)-c(1)), c(2)*c(3).^s./c(2).^s, ...
       c(3)+s*(c(4)-c(3)), c(4)*c(1).^s./c(4).^s);
  clf, plot(z), axis equal, axis off

%%
% The integral of $f(z) = \log(z)\tanh(z)$ around this contour will be equal to
% $2\pi i$ times the sum of the residues at the poles of $f$ at $\pm \pi i/2$.
f = log(z)*tanh(z);
I = sum(f*diff(z))
Iexact = 4i*pi*log(pi/2)

%% 5.4 Cauchy integrals and locating zeros and poles
% Here are some further examples of computations with Cauchy integrals. The
% Bernoulli number $B_k$ is $k!$ times the kth Taylor coefficient of
% $z/(\exp(z)-1)$. Here is $B_{10}$ compared with its exact value $5/66$.
k = 10;
z = chebfun('4*exp(1i*s)',[0 2*pi],'trig');
f = z/((exp(z)-1));
B10 = factorial(k)*sum((f/z^(k+1))*diff(z))/(2i*pi)
exact = 5/66

%%
% Notice that we have taken |z| to be a circle of radius $4$. If the radius is
% $1$, the accuracy is a good deal lower:
z = chebfun('exp(1i*s)',[0 2*pi],'trig');
f = z/((exp(z)-1));
B10 = factorial(k)*sum((f/z^(k+1))*diff(z))/(2i*pi)

%%
% This problem of numerical instability would arise no matter how one
% calculated the integral over the unit circle; it is not the fault of
% Chebfun.  For a study of how to pick the optimal radius, see [Bornemann
% 2009].

%%
% Another use of Cauchy integrals is to count zeros or poles of functions
% in specified regions.  According to the *principle of the argument*, the
% number of zeros minus the number of poles of $f$ in a region is
% $$ N = {1\over 2\pi i} \int { f'(z) \over f(z)} dz, $$
% where the integral is taken over the boundary.  Since $f' = df/dz =
% (df/ds)(ds/dz)$, we can rewrite this as
% $$ N = {1\over 2\pi i} \int {1\over f} {df\over ds} ds. $$
% For example, the function $f(z) = \sin(z)^3 + \cos(z)^3$ clearly has no
% poles; how many zeros does it have in the disk about $0$ of radius $2$? The
% following calculation shows that the answer is $3$:
z = chebfun('2*exp(1i*s)',[0 2*pi]);
f = sin(z)^3 + cos(z)^3;
N = sum((diff(f)./f))/(2i*pi)

%%
% What is really going on here is a calculation of the change of the
% argument of $f$ as the boundary is traversed.  Another way to find that
% number is with the Chebfun overloads of the MATLAB commands |angle|
% and |unwrap|:
anglef = unwrap(angle(f));
N = (anglef(end)-anglef(0))/(2*pi)

%%
% Variations on this idea enable one to locate zeros and poles as well as
% count them.  For example, we can locate a single zero with the formula
% $$ r = {1\over 2\pi i} \int  z (df/ds)/f ds $$
% [McCune 1966].  Here is the zero of the function above in the unit disk:
z = chebfun('exp(1i*s)',[0 2*pi],'trig');
f = sin(z)^3 + cos(z)^3;
r = sum(z*(diff(f)/f))/(2i*pi)

%%
% We can check the result by a more ordinary Chebfun calculation:
x = chebfun('x');
f = sin(x)^3 + cos(x)^3;
r = roots(f)

%%
% To find multiple zeros via Cauchy integrals, and for many other 
% generalizations of the ideas in this chapter,
% see [Austin, Kravanja & Trefethen 2013].

%% 5.5 Alphabet soup
% The Chebfun command |scribble| returns a piecewise linear complex chebfun
% corresponding to a word spelled out in capital letters.  For example:
f = scribble('Oxford University');
LW = 'linewidth'; lw = 2;
plot(f,LW,lw), xlim(1.1*[-1 1]), axis equal

%%
% This chebfun happens to have 67 pieces:
length(domain(f))-1

%%
% Though its applications are unlikely to be mathematical, $f$ is a precisely
% defined mathematical object just like any other chebfun.  If we wish, we
% can compute with it:
f(0), norm(f)

%%
% Perhaps more interesting is that we can apply functions to it and learn
% something in the process:
plot(exp(3i*f),'m',LW,lw), ylim(1.2*[-1 1]), axis equal

%%
% Does putting a box around enhance the image? (We do this by adding a
% second column of a Chebfun quasimatrix -- see Chapter 6.)
L = f.ends(end);
s = chebfun(@(x) 2*x+2,[-1 -0.5]);
box = join(-1.1-.05i+2.2*s,1.1-.05i+.22i*s,1.1+.17i-2.2*s,-1.1+.17i-.22i*s);
f = [f box];
plot(f,LW,lw), xlim(1.2*[-1 1]), axis equal

%%
clf, plot(exp((1+.2i)*f),LW,lw), axis equal, axis off

%%
plot(tan(f),LW,lw), axis equal, axis off

%%
% Next May 16, you might wish to write a greeting card for Pafnuty Lvovich
% Chebyshev, accurate as always to 15 digits:
f = scribble('Happy Birthday Pafnuty!');
L = f.ends(end);
g = @(z) exp(-2.2i+(2.5i+.4)*z);
clf, plot(g(f),'r',LW,lw)
circle = 1.12*chebfun(@(x) exp(2i*pi*x/L),[0 L]);
ellipse = 1.2*(circle + 1/circle)/2 + 1i*mean(imag(f));
hold on, plot(g(ellipse),'b',LW,lw)
axis auto equal off
