%% 13. Chebfun2: Integration and Differentiation
% Alex Townsend, March 2013, latest revision October 2019
 
%% 13.1 |sum| and |sum2|
% We have already seen the |sum2| command, which returns the definite double
% integral of a chebfun2 over its domain of definition. The |sum| command 
% is a little different, integrating with respect to one variable
% at a time following the MATLAB analogy. For
% instance, the following commands integrate $\sin(10xy)$
% with respect to $y$: 
f = chebfun2(@(x,y) sin(10*x.*y),[0 pi/4 0 3]); 
sum(f) 

%%
% A chebfun is returned because the result depends on $x$ and hence is a 
% function of one variable.  Similarly, we can integrate over the
% $x$ variable and plot the result. 
sum(f,2), plot(sum(f,2)) 

%% 
% A closer look reveals that |sum(f)| returns a row
% chebfun while |sum(f,2)| returns a column chebfun. This distinction is 
% a reminder that |sum(f)| is a function of $x$ while |sum(f,2)| is a function
% of $y$. If we integrate over $y$ and then $x$, the result
% is the double integral of $f$.
sum2(f)
sum(sum(f))

%% 
% It is interesting to compare the execution times involved for
% computing the double integral by different commands.  Chebfun2 does very 
% well for smooth functions, with times comparable to those of the
% MATLAB |integral2| command.
F = @(x,y) exp(-(x.^2 + y.^2 + cos(4*x.*y))); 
tol = 3e-14; 
tic, I = integral2(F,-1,1,-1,1,'AbsTol',tol); t = toc;
fprintf('      INTEGRAL2:  I = %17.15f  time = %6.4f secs\n',I,t)
tic, I = sum(sum(chebfun2(F))); t = toc;
fprintf('CHEBFUN2/SUMSUM:  I = %17.15f  time = %6.4f secs\n',I,t)
tic, I = sum2(chebfun2(F)); t = toc;
fprintf('  CHEBFUN2/SUM2:  I = %17.15f  time = %6.4f secs\n',I,t)

%% 
% Chebfun2 is not designed specifically for numerical quadrature (or
% more properly, "cubature"), and
% careful comparisons with existing software have not been carried out.
% Low rank function approximations have been previously used for numerical
% quadrature by Carvajal, Chapman, and Geddes [Carvajal, Chapman & Geddes
% 2005].  A cubature package CHEBINT based on Chebyshev approximations
% has been produced by Poppe and Cools [Poppe & Cools 2013].

%% 13.2 |norm|, |mean|, and |mean2|
% The $L^2$-norm of a function $f(x,y)$ can be computed as the square root of the 
% double integral of $f^2$. In Chebfun2 the command |norm(f)|, 
% without any additional arguments, computes this quantity. For example, 
f = chebfun2('exp(-(x.^2 + y.^2 +4*x.*y))');
norm(f), sqrt(sum2(f.^2))

%%
% Here is another example. This time we compute the norms of $f(x,y)$, 
% $\cos(f(x,y))$, and $f(x,y)^5$.
f = chebfun2(@(x,y) exp(-1./( sin(x.*y) + x ).^2));
norm(f), norm( cos(f) ), norm( f.^5 )
%% 
% The command |mean2| scales the result of |sum2| to return
% the mean value of $f$ over the rectangle of definition.
% For example, here is the average value of a 2D Runge function. 
runge = chebfun2( @(x,y) 1./( .01 + x.^2 + y.^2 )) ;  
plot(runge)
mean2(runge)

%%
% The command |mean| computes 
% the average along one variable.  The output is a
% function of one variable represented by a chebfun, so we can plot it.
plot(mean(runge))
title('Mean value of 2D Runge function wrt y')

%%
% If we average over $y$ and then
% $x$, we obtain the mean value over the whole domain,
% matching the earlier result.
mean(mean(runge)) 

%% 13.3 |cumsum| and |cumsum2|
% The command |cumsum2| computes the double indefinite integral, which is a
% function of two variables, and returns a chebfun2. 
% On the other hand, |cumsum(f)| computes the indefinite integral 
% with respect to just one variable, also returning a chebfun2.
% The indefinite integral with respect to $y$ and then
% $x$ is the same as the double indefinite
% integral, as we can check numerically. 
f = chebfun2(@(x,y) sin(3*((x+1).^2+(y+1).^2)));
contour(cumsum2(f)), axis equal
title('Contours of cumsum2(f)'), axis([-1 1 -1 1])
norm( cumsum(cumsum(f),2) - cumsum2(f) ) 

%% 13.4 Complex encoding
% As is well known, a pair of real scalar functions $f$ and $g$ can be 
% encoded as a complex function $f+ig$. This trick can be useful
% for simplifying many operations, though at the same time it may be confusing.
% For instance, instead of representing the unit circle by two real-valued
% functions, we can represent it by one complex-valued function:
d = [0 2*pi];
c1 = chebfun(@(t) cos(t),d);           % first real-valued function
c2 = chebfun(@(t) sin(t),d);           % second real-valued function 
c = chebfun(@(t) cos(t)+1i*sin(t),d);  % one complex function

%%
% Here are two ways to make a plot of a circle.
subplot(1,2,1), plot(c1,c2)
axis equal, title('Two real-valued functions')
subplot(1,2,2), plot(c)
axis equal, title('One complex-valued function')

%%
% This complex encoding trick is exploited in a number of places in 
% Chebfun2. Specifically, it's used to encode the path of integration 
% for a line integral
% (see next section), to represent zero contours of a chebfun2 
% (Chapter 14), and to represent trajectories in vector 
% fields (Chapter 15). 

%%
% We hope users become comfortable with complex encodings, though 
% they are not required for the majority of Chebfun2
% functionality. 

%% 13.5 Integration along curves
% Chebfun2 can compute the integral of $f(x,y)$ along a curve $(x(t),y(t))$. 
% It uses the complex encoding trick and encodes the curve $(x(t),y(t))$ 
% as a complex valued chebfun $x(t) + iy(t)$.

%%
% For example, here is the curve 
% in the unit square defined by $\exp(10 it)$, $t\in[0,1]$. 
clf
C = chebfun(@(t) t*exp(10i*t),[0 1]);         
plot(C,'k'), axis([-1 1 -1 1]), axis square

%%
% Here is a plot of the function 
% $f(x,y) = \cos(10xy^2) + \exp(-x^2)$ on the square,
% with the values of $f(x,y)$ on the curve $C$ shown in black:
f = chebfun2(@(x,y) cos(10*x.*y.^2) + exp(-x.^2));
plot(f), hold on 
plot3(real(C),imag(C),f(C),'k')

%%
% The object $|f(C)|$ is just a real-valued function defined
% on $[0,1]$, whose integral we can readily compute: 
sum(f(C))

%%
% This number can be interpreted as the integral of $f(x,y)$ along
% the curve $C$.

%% 13.6 |diff|, |diffx|, |diffy|
% In MATLAB the |diff| command calculates finite differences of a matrix 
% along its columns (by default) or rows. For a chebfun2 the same syntax 
% represents partial differentiation $\partial f/\partial y$ (by default) or 
% $\partial f/\partial x$.

%%
% As pointed out in the last chapter, however, this can be rather
% confusing.  Accordingly Chebfun2 offers the alternatives
% |diffx| and |diffy| with more obvious meaning.  
% Here we use |diffx| and |diffy|
% to check that the Cauchy-Riemann equations hold for an 
% analytic function. 
f = chebfun2(@(x,y) sin(x+1i*y));   % a holomorphic function
u = real(f); v = imag(f);           % real and imaginary parts
norm(diffy(v) - diffx(u))      
norm(diffx(v) + diffy(u))           % Do the Cauchy-Riemann eqs hold?

%% 13.7 Integration in three variables 
% Chebfun2 also works pretty well for integration in three variables.
% The idea is to integrate over two of the variables using Chebfun2 and the
% remaining variable using Chebfun. We have selected a tolerance of $10^{-6}$
% for this example because the default tolerance in the MATLAB |integral3| 
% command is also $10^{-6}$.
r = @(x,y,z) sqrt(x.^2 + y.^2 + z.^2); 
t = @(x,y,z) acos(z./r(x,y,z)); p = @(x,y,z) atan(y./x);
f = @(x,y,z) sin(5*(t(x,y,z) - r(x,y,z))) .* sin(p(x,y,z)).^2;

I = @(z) sum2(chebfun2(@(x,y) f(x,y,z),[-2 2 .5 2.5]));
tic, I = sum(chebfun(@(z) I(z),[1 2],'vectorize')); t = toc;
fprintf('          Chebfun2:  I = %16.14f  time = %5.3f secs\n',I,t)
tic, I = integral3(f,-2,2,.5,2.5,1,2,'abstol',3e-14,'reltol',3e-14); t = toc;
fprintf('  MATLAB integral3:  I = %16.14f  time = %5.3f secs\n',I,t)

%%
% We can also do the integral with Chebfun3 -- see Chapter 18:
tic, f3 = chebfun3(f,[-2 2 .5 2.5 1 2]); I = sum3(f3); t = toc;
fprintf('          Chebfun3:  I = %16.14f  time = %5.3f secs\n',I,t)
