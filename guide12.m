%% 12. Chebfun2: Getting Started
% Alex Townsend, March 2013, latest revision July 2019

%% 12.1  What is a chebfun2?
% Chebfun2 is the part of Chebfun that deals with functions of
% two variables defined on a rectangle $[a,b]\times[c,d]$.
% Just like Chebfun in 1D, it is an extremely convenient tool
% for all kinds of computations including algebraic 
% manipulation, optimization, integration, and rootfinding.
% It also extends to vector-valued functions of two variables, so
% that one can perform vector calculus. 

%%
% For example, here is a test function that has been part of
% MATLAB for many years.  MATLAB represents the "peaks" function
% by a $49\times 49$ matrix:
peaks

%%
% The same function is available as a chebfun2 in the
% Chebfun2 gallery:
f = cheb.gallery2('peaks');
plot(f), axis tight, title('Chebfun2 Peaks')

%%
% Of course in Chebfun we can do all sorts of things with
% functions to high accuracy, such as evaluate them
f(0.5,0.5)

%%
% or compute their maxima,
max2(f)

%%
% A chebfun2, with a lower-case "c", is a MATLAB object, the
% 2D analogue of a chebfun.
% The syntax for chebfun2 objects is similar to the syntax 
% for matrices in MATLAB, and Chebfun2 objects have many MATLAB commands
% overloaded. For instance, |trace(A)| returns the sum of the diagonal entries
% of a matrix $A$ and |trace(f)| returns the integral of
% $f(x,x)$ when $f$ is a chebfun2. 

%%
% Chebfun2 builds on Chebfun's univariate representations and
% algorithms.  Algorithmic details
% are given in [Townsend & Trefethen 2013b] and mathematical
% underpinnings in [Townsend & Trefethen 2014].
% For more information, see Section 12.8.

%% 12.2 What is a chebfun2v?
% Chebfun2 can represent scalar-valued functions, such as $\exp(x+y)$, and
% vector-valued functions, such as $[\exp(x+y);\cos(x-y)]$. 
% A vector-valued function is called a chebfun2v, and chebfun2v objects
% are useful for
% computations of vector calculus. For information about
% chebfun2v objects and vector calculus, see Chapters 15 and 16 of this
% guide.

%% 12.3 Constructing chebfun2 objects
% A chebfun2 can be constructed by supplying the Chebfun2 constructor with a
% bivariate function handle or string. The default rectangular domain is 
% $[-1,1]\times [-1,1]$. (An example showing how to specify a different domain is 
% given at the end of this chapter.) For example, here we construct and
% plot a chebfun2 representing $\cos(2\pi xy)$ on $[-1,1]\times[-1,1]$.
f = chebfun2(@(x,y) cos(2*pi*x.*y)); 

%%
% We could equally well have constructed chebfun2 objects for
% the variables $x$ and $y$ first and then computed $f$ from these:
x = chebfun2(@x,y) x); 
y = chebfun2(@x,y) y); 
f = cos(2*pi*x.*y); 

%%
% There's also a shortcut |cheb.xy| to constructing these objects |x| and |y|,
% so we could also have executed
cheb.xy
f = cos(2*pi*x.*y); 

%%
% Here is a plot of $f$:
plot(f), zlim([-2 2])

%% 
% Along with |plot|, there are also commands
% |contour| and |surf| for displaying a chebfun2.
% Here is a contour plot of $f$:
contour(f), axis square

%%
% One way to find the rank of the approximant used to represent $f$, 
% discussed in Section 8.8, is like this:
length(f)

%%
% Alternatively, more information can be given by displaying the chebfun2
% object: 
f

%%
% The corner values are the values of the chebfun2 at 
% $(-1,-1)$, $(-1,1)$, $(1,-1)$, and $(1,1)$, in that order. The vertical scale is
% used by operations to aim for close to machine precision relative 
% to that number. 

%% 12.4 Basic operations
% Once we have a chebfun2, we can compute
% quantities such as its definite double integral:
sum2(f)

%%
% This matches well the exact answer obtained by calculus,
% which is $(2/\pi)\hbox{Si}(2\pi)$:
exact = 0.9028233335802806267957003779

%%
% We can also evaluate a chebfun2 at a point $(x,y)$, or along a line.
% When evaluating along a line a chebfun is returned because the answer is
% a function of one variable.

%%
% Evaluation at a point:
x = 2*rand - 1; y = 2*rand - 1; 
f(x,y) 

%% 
% Evaluation along the line $y = \pi/6$:
f(:,pi/6)

%% 
% There are plenty of other questions that may be of interest.  For
% instance, what are the zero contours of $f(x,y) - .95$? 
r = roots(f-.95);
plot(r), axis([-1 1 -1 1])
axis square, title('Zero contours of f-.95')


%%
% What is the partial derivative $\partial f/\partial y$? 
fy = diff(f,1,1);
plot(fy)

%%
% The syntax for the |diff| command can cause confusion because we are
% following the matrix syntax in MATLAB. Chebfun2 also
% offers the more easily remembered |diffx(f,k)| and 
% |diffy(f,k)|, which differentiate $f(x,y)$ $k$ times with respect
% to the first and second variable, respectively.

%%
% What is the mean value of $f$ on $[-1,1]\times[-1,1]$? 
mean2(f) 

%% 12.5 Chebfun2 methods
% There are over 100 methods that can be applied to chebfun2 objects. For a
% complete list type:
methods chebfun2

%% 
% Most of these commands have been overloaded from MATLAB. 
% More information about a Chebfun2 command can be found with |help|:
help chebfun2/max2

%% 12.6 Composition of chebfun2 objects
% So far, in this chapter,
% chebfun2 objects have been constructed explicitly via a command
% of the form |chebfun2(...)|. Another way to construct new
% chebfun2 objects is by composing them together with operations such as 
% |+|, |-|, |.*|, and |.^|. For example,
x = chebfun2(@(x,y) x, [-2 3 -4 4]); 
y = chebfun2(@(x,y) y, [-2 3 -4 4]);   

f = 1./( 2 + cos(.25 + x.^2.*y + y.^2) );
contour(f), axis equal

%% 12.7 Analytic functions
% An analytic function $f(z)$ can be thought of as a complex-valued 
% function of two real variables, $f(x,y) = f(x+iy)$. If the Chebfun2 
% constructor is given an anonymous function with one argument, 
% it assumes that argument is a complex variable. For instance, 
f = chebfun2(@(z) sin(z));   
f(1+1i), sin(1+1i)           

%% 
% These functions can be visualised by using a technique known as phase
% portrait plots. Given a complex number $z = re^{i\theta}$, the
% phase $e^{i\theta}$ can be represented by a colour. We follow Wegert's colour 
% recommendations [Wegert 2012], using red for a phase $i$, then yellow, 
% green, blue, and violet as the phase moves clockwise around the unit 
% circle. For example, 
f = chebfun2(@(z) sin(z)-sinh(z),2*pi*[-1 1 -1 1]);
plot(f)

%% 
% Many properties of analytic functions can be visualised by these types
% of plots, such as the location of zeros and their multiplicities.
% Can you work out the multiplicity of the root at $z=0$ from this plot?
% For another example, try `cheb.gallery2('airycomplex')`.

%%
% Since Chebfun2 only represents smooth functions, a trick is
% required to draw pictures like these for
% functions with poles [Trefethen 2013].  
% For functions with branch points or essential singularities, it is currently
% not possible in Chebfun2 to draw phase plots.

%% 12.8 Chebfun2 low rank approximations
% Chebfun2 exploits the observation that many
% functions of two variables can be well approximated by low rank approximants.
% A rank $1$ function, also known as _separable_,
% is of the form $u(y)v(x)$, and a rank $k$ function is one that can be
% written as the sum of $k$ rank $1$ functions. Smooth functions tend to be 
% well approximated by functions of low rank.  
% Chebfun2 determines low rank function approximations automatically
% by means of an algorithm that 
% can be viewed as an iterative application of Gaussian elimination with 
% complete pivoting [Townsend & Trefethen 2013]. 
% The underlying function representations are related to work by Carvajal, 
% Chapman and Geddes [Carvajal, Chapman, & Geddes 2008] and others including
% Bebendorf [Bebendorf 2008], Hackbusch, Khoromskij, Oseledets, and Tyrtyshnikov.
% For further aspects of low-rank representations see
% [Trefethen 2017] and [Beckermann and Townsend 2019].

%%
% Here is an exampled adapted from
% [Townsend & Trefethen 2013] and `cheb.gallery2('smokering')`.
% The function 
% $$ f(x,y) = \exp( -40(x^2-xy+2y^2 - 1/2)^2) $$
% has the shape of an elliptical ring in the unit square, 
% and Chebfun2 represents it by an approximation of reasonably
% high rank:
ff = @(x,y) exp(-40*(x.^2 - x.*y + 2*y.^2 - 1/2).^2);
f = chebfun2(ff);
levels = 0.1:0.1:0.9;
contour(f,levels), axis([-1 1 -1 1]), axis square
title(['rank ' int2str(length(f))],'fontsize',12)

%%
% To illustrate the nature of low-rank approximations, rather
% than letting Chebfun2 determine the rank adaptively, we
% can force it to take ranks $1,2,\dots ,9$.  Here are the results,
% plotted with black level curves at heights $0.2,0.4,0.6,0.8$:
levels = 0.2:0.2:0.8;
clf
for k = 1:9
    axes('position',[.03+.33*mod(k-1,3) .67-.3*floor((k-1)/3) .28 .28])
    contour(chebfun2(ff,k),levels,'k')
    xlim([-1 1]), axis equal, axis off
end

%%
% For this function, "plotting accuracy" is achieved approximately
% at rank 16; the remaining terms are then required to get from
% 2-3 digits to 15.
