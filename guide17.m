%% 17.1 Introduction
% Spherefun is the part of Chebfun for computing with functions
% defined on the surface of the unit sphere. It was created by Alex
% Townsend, Heather Wilber, and Grady Wright.

%%
% <latex>
% In what follows "the sphere" is more precisely the surface of the unit 
% 2-sphere in 3 dimensions, $\mathbb{S}^2$.
% </latex>

%%
% <latex>
% A function on the sphere can be expressed in terms of Cartesian coordinates
% $(x,y,z)$ or spherical coordinates $(\lambda,\theta)$, where
% $\lambda$ is the azimuth (longitude) angle and $\theta$ is the polar (or
% zenith) angle. The transformation between these two
% coordinate systems in Spherefun is given by
% \begin{equation}
% x = \cos\lambda\sin\theta, \quad y = \sin\lambda\sin\theta, \quad z =
% \cos\theta,\qquad (\lambda,\theta)\in[-\pi,\pi]\times[0,\pi].
% \label{eq:sphCoords}
% \end{equation}
% </latex>

%%
% Spherefun allows functions to be constructed using either coordinate
% system.  For example, the function $f(x,y,z) = (1 + (x+1/\sqrt{2})^2 + z^2)$ 
% on the sphere can be constructed as follows:
f = spherefun( @(x,y,z) 1./(1 + (x+1/sqrt(2)).^2 + z.^2) );
plot( f )

%%
% <latex>
% Or, equivalently, the function can be constructed in spherical coordinates as
% </latex> 
g = spherefun( @(lam,theta) 1./(1 + (cos(lam).*sin(theta)+1/sqrt(2)).^2 +...
                cos(theta).^2) );
            
%%
% <latex>
% The result is the same up to machine precision:
% </latex>
norm( f - g, inf ) 

%% 
% The constructed objects are called spherefuns:
f

%%
% The output shows that $f$ is numerically of rank 21 (see the discussion
% below for what this means) and its vertical scale (an approximation
% to its maximum absolute value) is 1. 

%%
% Many of the methods available as part of Spherefun can work in Cartesian
% or spherical coordinates.  After construction, this is perhaps most
% useful for evaluation.  For example, $(-1/\sqrt{2},1/\sqrt{2},0)$ in
% spherical coordinates defined above is $(3\pi/4,\pi/2)$. |f| or |g| can
% be evaluated at this point using either representation to get the exact
% value of $1$:
[  f(-1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2), 0)    f(3*pi/4, pi/2) ]

%%
% If the evaluation point is specified in Cartesian coordinates and does
% not lie on the sphere (to within a small tolerance), then an error is 
% reported.  If the evaluation point is numerically close to the sphere (up
% to rounding errors), then the evaluation point is projected onto the
% unit sphere. 

%%
% Slices of the function along the coordinate planes intersecting the
% sphere can also be obtained, with the result being chebfuns.  For
% example, |f| along the equator is obtained using spherical coordinates as
fequator = f(:,pi/2)
plot(fequator)

%%
% Cartesian coordinates can also be used to obtain slices of functions.  
% For example, |f| along the plane $x=1/4$ intersecting the sphere is
fslice = f(0.25,:,:)
plot(fslice)

%% 
% In the spirit of Chebfun, one can compute with spherefuns without worrying
% about the underlying discretization or how a particular algorithm is
% implemented. At every step we aim to achieve close to machine precision
% results, while compressing representations wherever possible.

%% 
% Using object-oriented programming in MATLAB there are about one hundred
% commands that one can now perform on spherefuns. 

%% 17.2 Basic operations
% <latex>
% Once we have a spherefun, we can execute a whole collection of commands.
% For example, the surface integral of 
% $$ f(x,y,z) = 1 + x + y^2 + x^2 y + x^4 + y^5 + (xyz)^2 $$
% is 
% </latex>
f = spherefun( @(x,y,z) 1+x+y.^2+x.^2.*y+x.^4+y.^5+(x.*y.*z).^2 );
sum2( f )

%%
% <latex>
% This matches the exact value of $216\pi/35$ to 15 digits
% </latex>
abs( sum2( f ) - 216*pi/35 )

%%
% The mean of $f$ is
mean2( f )

%%
% <latex>
% Since the surface area of the sphere is $4\pi$, the exact value of the 
% mean of $f$ is 
% </latex>
54/35

%%
% The global maximum of a function on the sphere can be computed with  
% |max2|.  For example, the maximum of
% $f(x,y,z) = 2\sinh(5xyz)$ is 
f = spherefun( @(x,y,z) 2*sinh(5*x.*y.*z) );
maxf = max2( f )

%%
% This matches the exact value $2\sinh(5/3^{3/2})$ to nearly machine 
% precision:
abs( maxf- 2*sinh(5*3^(-3/2)) )

%%
% The method |min2| similarly gives the global minimum.  For the function
% above the global minimum is just the negative of the global maximum:
min2(f)

%%
% The zero contours of |f-0.5| can be computed using |roots|
r = roots( f-0.5 );

%%
% <latex>
% Here is a plot of these contours on the surface of the sphere together with the 
% function $f$
% </latex>
plot( f ), colorbar, hold on,
for k = 1 : size(r, 1)
     plot3( r{k}(:,1), r{k}(:,2), r{k}(:,3), 'k-' , 'linewidth', 2 )
end
hold off

%%
% <latex>
% Contours of a function can also be visualized on the sphere using the
% `contour` function.  Here are the contours of $f$ from $-2$ to $2$ in
% increments of $0.25$
% </latex>
contour(f,-2:0.25:2)

%%
% <latex>
% The landmasses of earth can be added to this, or any other plot of a 
% spherefun, as follows:
% </latex>
hold on, spherefun.plotEarth('k-'), hold off, view([45 20])

%% 
% <latex>
% Differentiation of a function on the sphere with respect to spherical
% coordinates $(\lambda,\theta)$ can lead to singularities at the poles,
% even for smooth functions.  For example, the function 
% $f(\lambda,\theta) = \cos\theta$ (or $f(x,y,z) = z$) is smooth on the
% sphere, but the $\theta$-derivative, $\sin\theta$, is not smooth at
% either pole. This issue arises because the unit vector in the polar
% direction of the spherical coordinate system has a discontinuity at the
% north and south poles. To bypass this problem, we have chosen in
% Spherefun to define derivatives on the sphere in terms of the components
% that make up the surface gradient with respect to the Cartesian
% coordinate system.  By defining derivatives in this fashion, we are
% guaranteed that any derivative of a smooth function will be smooth over
% the entire sphere.
% </latex>

%%
% The |diff| method is used to compute these derivatives.  For example,
% the $x$ and $z$ components of the surface gradient of |f| are
dfdx = diff( f, 1 );
plot( dfdx ), title( 'x-component of the surface gradient')
snapnow

dfdz = diff( f, 3 );
plot(dfdz), title( 'z-component of the surface gradient')
snapnow

%%
% The surface Laplacian of |f| is 
lapf = laplacian( f );
clf, plot( lapf )

%%
% Finally, as with chebfun and chebfun2 objects, we can add, subtract,
% and multiply simple spherefuns together.
g = spherefun( @(l,t) 2*cos(10*cos(l-0.25).*cos(l).*(sin(t).*cos(t)).^2) ); 
plot( g ), title('g'), snapnow
h = f + g; 
plot( h ), title('f + g'), snapnow
h = f - g;
plot( h ), title('f - g'), snapnow
h = f.*g;
plot( h ), title('f x g'), snapnow

%%
% For a complete list of methods available for spherefuns, type `methods
% spherefun`.  Many of these are inherited from the abstract
% |separableApprox| class that was introduced in Chebfun version 5.3. It is
% fascinating to go through these commands and ask: "What is the analogous
% operation for functions on the sphere?" We certainly do not have all the
% answers yet.

%% 17.3 Low rank function approximation 
% <latex>
% The initial plan for Spherefun was to apply the iterative Gaussian
% elimination algorithm  for constructing low rank function approximations
% that forms the foundation of Chebfun2 [Townsend & Trefethen 2013] to
% functions on the sphere. However, a direct application of this algorithm
% results in difficulties with some operations (e.g., differentiation) as
% important symmetries and regularity conditions at the north and south
% poles are not preserved. This led to the development of a new algorithm
% for representing functions on the sphere that combines the double Fourier
% sphere method and a symmetry preserving variant of iterative Gaussian
% elimination. We give a brief overview of algorithms here. For a full
% description of the mathematics behind Spherefun see [Townsend, Wilber, &
% Wright 2016].
% </latex>

%%
% <latex>
% The sphere has no boundary, and 
% functions defined on the sphere are periodic.  When transforming 
% functions on the sphere to spherical coordinates $(\lambda,\theta)$ 
% (see \eqref{eq:sphCoords}), they become $2\pi$-periodic in $\lambda$, but
% not periodic in $\theta$. The transformation introduces an artificial 
% boundary at the north ($\theta=0$) and south ($\theta=\pi$) poles.  The
% double Fourier sphere (DFS) method, first introduced by Merilees
% [Merilees 1973], uses symmetries inherent to spherical coordinates to
% recover the double-periodicity of functions on the sphere.  The idea is
% to extend a function $f$ on $[-\pi,\pi]\times[0,\pi]$ in spherical
% coordinates to a related function $\tilde{f}$ on
% $[-\pi,\pi]\times[-\pi,\pi]$ as follows:
% \begin{equation} 
%  \tilde{f}(\lambda,\theta) = 
%  \begin{cases} 
%   g(\lambda+\pi,\theta), & (\lambda,\theta)\in[-\pi,0]\times[0,\pi],\cr 
%   h(\lambda,\theta), & (\lambda,\theta)\in[0,\pi]\times[0,\pi],\cr 
%   g(\lambda,-\theta), & (\lambda,\theta)\in[0,\pi]\times[-\pi,0],\cr
%   h(\lambda+\pi,-\theta), & (\lambda,\theta)\in[-\pi,0]\times[-\pi,0],
%  \end{cases}
% \label{eq:BMCsphere}
% \end{equation} 
% where $g(\lambda,\theta)=f(\lambda-\pi,\theta)$ and
% $h(\lambda,\theta)=f(\lambda,\theta)$ for
% $(\lambda,\theta)\in[0,\pi]\times[0,\pi]$. The new function $\tilde{f}$
% is $2\pi$-periodic in $\lambda$ and $\theta$, and is constant along the
% lines $\theta=0$ and $\theta=\pm \pi$, corresponding to the poles.
% Assuming $f$ is smooth, the extended function $\tilde{f}$ 
% can be represented in a double Fourier (or trigonometric) series,
% \begin{equation}
%  \tilde{f}(\lambda,\theta) = \sum_{j=-\infty}^{\infty}\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} \widehat{X}_{jk} e^{ij\theta} e^{ik\lambda}, \label{eq:2DFourierExpansion}
% \end{equation}
% which gives the DFS method its name.
% Note that the Fourier coefficients will satisfy certain properties based
% on the symmetries of the extension \eqref{eq:BMCsphere} [Yee 1980].
% </latex>

%%
% <latex>
% Spherefun uses a symmetry preserving variant of iterative Gaussian
% elimination to construct low rank approximations to $\tilde{f}$
% [Townsend, Wilber, & Wright 2015]. The result of this algorithm is a
% rank $K$ approximation to $\tilde{f}$ of the form
% \begin{align}
%  \tilde{f}(\lambda,\theta) \approx \sum_{j=1}^K d_j
%  c_j(\theta)r_j(\lambda),
% \end{align} 
% where each rank 1 function $c_j(\theta)r_j(\lambda)$ satisfies the 
% symmetry of the DFS extension \eqref{eq:BMCsphere} to infinite 
% precision. This is fundamental for making operations such as 
% differentiation well-posed and numerically stable. The functions
% $r_j(\lambda)$ and $c_j(\theta)$ are constructed from samples of 
% $\tilde{f}$ along horizontal and vertical "slices", respectively, of
% the rectangular domain $[-\pi,\pi]\times[-\pi,\pi]$.  Since $\tilde{f}$
% is periodic along these slices, $r_j(\lambda)$ and $c_j(\theta)$ are
% represented by trigonometric interpolants 
% (or `trigfuns`; see Chapter 11).
% </latex>

%%
% <latex>
% To illustrate the representation, consider the function 
% $f(x,y,z) = \cos(\cosh(5x z) - 10y)$:
% </latex>
f = spherefun( @(x,y,z) cos(cosh(5*x.*z)-10*y) )

%%
% <latex>
% Internally, the DFS method is applied to $f$ to obtain $\tilde{f}$ and
% this function is then approximated to nearly machine precision using a 
% rank $K=37$ approximant. The slices (also called the "skeleton") where
% the function is sampled during the construction process can be visualized
% using
% </latex>

% computed rapidly from `f`:

% <latex>
% There is an important byproduct of the low rank approximation algorithm
% that can be spied in the skeleton plot above showing the pivots.  If one were
% to use a tensor product method to reconstruct $f$, then any sampling grid
% conducive to fast periodic approximations would be artificially clustered
% near the north and south poles, resulting in an oversampling of $f$ in
% these regions.  The data-driven, highly adaptive nature of the low rank
% function approximation method diminishes these oversampling issues. The plot
% below illustrates this by comparing the samples of $f$ required by the
% low rank algorithm to the samples required by a full tensor product
% method to achieve the same accuracy. The plots are viewed from the south
% pole to illustrate the full clustering of the tensor product method (a
% similar picture results for the north pole).

% <latex>
% The Spherefun constructor accepts a few optional inputs that allow one
% to experiment with low rank approximants.  The rank of the
% approximant that results from the Gaussian elimination algorithm can be
% fixed at a specifed value.  For example, we can construct a rank 18
% approximant of $f(x,y,z) = \cos(\cosh(5x z) - 10y)$, instead of a rank 37
% approximant, 
% </latex>
f18 = spherefun( @(x,y,z) cos(cosh(5*x.*z)-10*y), 18 )
plot(f18)

%%
% Visually, this representation is identical to $f$, but this approximant
% is only accurate to about 3 digits.
norm(f-f18)

%%
% <latex>
% Additionally, the tolerances used during the construction process can 
% loosened from machine epsilon to achieve achieve a more compressed
% representation of the function, albeit at the cost of a less accurate
% approximation.  For example, we can loosen the tolerances in the
% construction of $f$ defined above to $10^{-8}$ as follows:
% </latex>
g = spherefun( @(x,y,z) cos(cosh(5*x.*z)-10*y), 'eps', 1e-8 )

%%
% This gives a rank 22 approximant.  The lengths of the rows and columns
% of this approximant (i.e. the number of trigonometric coefficients used
% in the approximation) compared to the original are
[mf,nf] = length(f);
[mg,ng] = length(g);
[mf mg]
[nf ng]

%%
% These modifications to the rank of the approximant and tolerances used
% seem to have more dramatic effects on the compression achieved when the 
% functions are smooth.

%% 17.4 Spherical harmonics 
% <latex>
% A natural question that may come to mind is, "Why not use spherical
% harmonic expansions?" One may think that
% spherical harmonic expansions are the right mathematical tool as
% they are the spherical analog of Fourier series. Yet, Spherefun does not
% use them at all. This is because of the difficulty of computing a
% spherical harmonic expansion of a function, despite three decades of
% research on fast algorithms. The current state-of-the-art algorithms have
% a large precomputation cost that makes highly adaptive discretizations
% computationally infeasible.
% </latex>

%%
% <latex>
% Because of the prevalence of spherical harmonics in many areas of
% science and engineering, we provide a method for constructing them in
% Spherefun.  For example, the spherical harmonic $Y_{\ell}^m$ of degree 
% $\ell=6$ and order $m=-3$ is constructed as
% </latex>
Y = spherefun.sphharm(6, -3);

%%
% <latex>
% Here $Y$ is represented to machine precision as a rank 1 function using
% the DFS method described above.  It can now be used in any subsequent
% computations.  For example, we can verify that it is indeed an eigenfunction
% of the surface Laplacian (in this case with eigenvalue $-6\times 7 =
% -42$)
% </latex>
plot( -42*Y ), title('-30Y_{6}^{-3}'), snapnow
plot( laplacian( Y ) ), title('\Delta Y_{6}^{-3}'), snapnow
norm( Y - (-1/42)*laplacian( Y ), inf)

%%
% The $\ell=6$, $m=-3$ coefficient in the spherical harmonic expansion
% of $f(x) = \cos(10x)\sin(10yz)$ is
sum2( spherefun( @(x,y,z) cos(10*x).*sin(10*y.*z) ).*Y )

%%
% Spherical harmonics of other degrees and orders can similarly be
% constructed and manipulated.

%% 17.5 Poisson equation
% <latex>
% Spherefun also has a command for solving the Poisson equation on the
% sphere. For example, to solve 
% $$
%   \nabla^2 u = f, \qquad \int_{\mathbb{S}^2} u\,d\Omega  = 0, 
% $$
% where $f = Y_{6}^{3}$, one can use these Spherefun commands:
% </latex>
f = spherefun.sphharm(6, 3);              % forcing term 
u = spherefun.poisson(f, 0, 100, 100);    % fast Poisson solver 

%% 
% Here the Poisson equation was solved with a discretization size of 
% $100\times 100$. The exact solution is $-(1/42)Y_6^3$ and has been
% recovered to machine precision: 
norm( u - -(1/42)*f, inf )

%%
% <latex>
% Provided that the right-hand side $f$ satisfies the compatibility condition
% $\int_{\mathbb{S}^2} f\, d\Omega  = 0$, the solution to the above Poisson
% problem is unique up to a constant. One specifies the value of this 
% constant as the second input argument to `poisson`. Here is a second
% example using a discretization size of $1000\times 1000$ and a value of
% 1 for this constant. 
% </latex>
f = spherefun( @(x,y,z) sin(100*x.*y.*z) );  % forcing term
u = spherefun.poisson(f, 1, 1000, 1000);     % fast Poisson solver 
plot( u )

%%
% See [Townsend, Wilber, & Wright 2015] for a description of the fast 
% algorithm used for solving Poisson's equation.

%% 17.6 Filtering
% Low-pass isotropic filtering for functions on the sphere can be performed
% using the command |gaussfilt|.
% For example, here is a smooth random spherefun:
rng(1), f = randnfunsphere(.1);
plot(f,'zebra'), colorbar

%%
% We can smooth |f| with a spatial scale of 0.3 like this:
ff = gaussfilt(f, 0.3);
plot(ff,'zebra'), colorbar

%%
% Mathematically, the |gaussfilt| command amounts
% to convolving |f| with a Gaussian
% kernel.  This is implemented by numerically solving the diffusion
% equation on the sphere with |f| as the initial condition. The second
% input argument of |gaussfilt| is an optional parameter $\sigma$ that
% determines the length scale (as measured in radians at the equator of the
% unit sphere) at which the smoothing occurs.  In the above example, this
% is set to $10\pi/180$, which corresponds to smoothing at a scale of 10
% degrees.

%% 17.7 Vector-valued functions: Spherefunv
% Vector valued functions on the sphere and _surface_ vector calculus
% operations are supported through Spherefunv.  For example, the surface
% gradient of a spherefun returns a spherefunv object:
f = spherefun.sphharm(6,0) + sqrt(14/11)*spherefun.sphharm(6,5);
g = grad( f );
clf, plot( f ), hold on
quiver( g ), hold off

%%
% Spherefunv objects consist of three spherefuns, which represent
% the vector-valued function in the _Cartesian_ coordinate system
g

%%
% The components are ordered as $x$, $y$, then $z$.  This choice of
% coordinate system is common in applications since then the components
% of the vector field will be smooth on the sphere. Using spherical
% coordinates would be problematic for the reasons discussed above: the unit
% vector in the polar direction of the spherical coordinate system has a
% discontinuity at the north and south poles.

%%
% Many of the operations for vector valued functions are supported.  For
% example, suppose $\psi$ is the following stream function for flow field
% (known as the Rosby-Haurwitz "wave number 4" stream function)
psi = spherefun( @(lam,th) -cos(th) + cos(th).*sin(th).^4.*cos(4*lam) );

%%
% The surface curl of $\psi$ gives a field that is tangent to the level 
% curves of $\psi$.
u = curl( psi );
plot( psi ), hold on, quiver( u ), hold off

%%
% The vorticity represents the local spinning motion of the field.
omega = vorticity( u );
plot( omega ), hold on, quiver( u ), hold off

%%
% The divergence of the field is
delta = div( u );

%% 
% Since $\mathbf{u} = \nabla \times \psi$, the field has zero divergence
norm( delta, inf ) 

%%

% spherefunv`.
