%% 16.1 Introduction
% Diskfun is a part of Chebfun for computing with
% 2D scalar and vector-valued functions on the unit disk. Conceptually,
% it is an extension of Chebfun2 to the polar setting, designed to accurately
% and efficiently perform over 100 operations. These include differentiation, 
% integration, vector calculus, and rootfinding, among many other things. 
% Diskfun was developed in tandem with Spherefun, and the two are algorithmically 
% closely related.  For complete details on the algorithms of both of these 
% classes, see [Townsend, Wilber & Wright, 2016], 
% [Wilber, Townsend & Wright, 2016].  Later, Ballfun was also created, for
% computing with functions in a spherical ball, as described in chapter 20.

%%
% To get started, we simply call the Diskfun constructor. In this example,
% we consider a Gaussian function.
LW = 'Linewidth'; MS = 'Markersize'; FS = 'Fontsize';
g = diskfun(@(x,y) exp(-10*((x-.3).^2+y.^2)));

%%
% <latex>
% When working with functions on the disk, it is sometimes convenient to
% express them in terms of polar coordinates. Given a function $f(x,y)$
% expressed in Cartesian coordinates, we apply the following transformation
% of variables:
% \begin{equation}
% x = \rho\cos\theta, \qquad y=\rho\sin\theta, \qquad (\theta, \rho) \in 
% [-\pi, \pi] \times [0, 1].
% \end{equation}
% This gives $f(\theta, \rho)$, where $\theta$ is the  _angular_
%  variable and $\rho$ is the _radial_ variable.
% </latex>
%%
% To construct |g| using polar coordinates, we include the
% flag |'polar'|. The result using either
% coordinate system is the same up to machine precision:
%%
f = diskfun(@(t, r) exp(-10*((r.*cos(t)-.3).^2+(r.*sin(t)).^2)), 'polar');
norm(f-g)
%%
% The object we have constructed is called a diskfun, with a lower case 'd'.
% We can find out more about a diskfun by printing it to the command line.
%%
f
%%
% <latex>
% The output describes the  _numerical_ rank of $f$,
% as well an approximation of the maximum absolute value of $f$ (the vertical scale).
% </latex>
%%
% To evaluate a diskfun, we can use either Cartesian (the default) or
% polar coordinates (with the |'polar'| flag):
%%
[  f(sqrt(2)/4, sqrt(2)/4)    f(pi/4,1/2, 'polar')  ]
%%
% We can also evaluate a univariate slice of $f$, in either the radial or
% angular coordinate. The result is returned as a chebfun, either as a nonperiodic
% or periodic function, respectively. Here, we plot three angular slices at
% the fixed radii $\rho = 1/4$, $1/3$, and $1/2$.
%%
c = f( : , [1/4 1/3 1/2] , 'polar');
plot(c(:,1), 'r', c(:,2), 'k', c(:,3), 'b')
title( 'Three angular slices of a diskfun' )
%%
% Whenever possible, we interpret commands with respect to the function
% in Cartesian coordinates. So, for example, the command  |diag| returns
% the radial slice $f(x,x)$ as a nonperiodic chebfun, and  |trace| is
% the integral of $f(x,x)$ over its domain, $[-1, 1]$.   (These are
% admittedly rather artificial operations.) 
%%
d = diag( f );
plot( d )
title( 'The diagonal slice of f' )
%%
trace_f = trace( f )   
int_d = sum( d )
%%
% Like the rest of Chebfun, Diskfun is designed to perform operations at
% close to machine precision, and using Diskfun requires no special
% knowledge about the underlying algorithms or discretization procedures.
%% 16.2 Basic operations
% A suite of commands are available in Diskfun, and here we describe only 
% a few. A complete listing can be found by typing  |methods diskfun| 
% in the MATLAB command line.
%%
% We start by adding, subtracting, and multiplying diskfuns together:
%%
g = diskfun(@(th, r) -40*(cos(((sin(pi*r).*cos(th)...
    + sin(2*pi*r).*sin(th)))/4))+39.5, 'polar');
f = diskfun( @(x,y) cos(15*((x-.2).^2+(y-.2).^2))...
    .*exp(-((x-.2)).^2-((y-.2)).^2));

plot( g )
title( 'g' ), axis off, snapnow

plot( f )
title( 'f' ), axis off, snapnow

h = g + f;
plot(h)
title( 'g + f' ), axis off, snapnow

h = g - f;
plot( h )
title( 'g - f' ), axis off, snapnow

h = g.*f;
plot( h )
title( 'g x f' ), axis off
%%
% In addition to algebraic operations, we can also solve unconstrained 
% global optimization problems. In this example, we use the command 
% |max2| to plot $f$ along with its maximum value.
[val, loc] = max2( f )
plot( f ), hold on, axis off, colorbar
plot3(loc(1), loc(2), val, 'k.', MS, 20), hold off
%%
% There are many ways to visualize a function on the disk. For example, 
% here is a contour plot of $g$, with the zero contours displayed in black:
%%
contour(g, 'Linewidth', 1.2), hold on, axis off
contour(g, [0 0], '-k', 'Linewidth', 2), hold off
%%
% The roots of a function (1D contours) can also be found explicitly. 
% Following the pattern of Chebfun2,
% the contours are stored as complex-valued chebfuns.
%%
r = roots(g);
plot(g),  colorbar, hold on
plot(r,'k',LW,2), axis off, hold off
%%
% One can also perform calculus on diskfuns. For instance, the integral of 
% the function $g(x,y) = -x^2 - 3xy-(y-1)^2$ over the unit disk can be 
% computed using the |sum2| command. We know that the exact answer is
% $-3\pi/2$.
%%
f = diskfun(@(x,y) -x.^2 - 3*x.*y-(y-1).^2);
intf = sum2(f)
tru = -3*pi/2
%%
% <latex>
% Differentiation on the disk with respect to the radial variable $\rho$
% can lead to singularities, even for smooth functions.
% For example, the function $f( \theta, \rho) = \rho \sin(\theta)$ is smooth
% on the disk, but $\partial f/ \partial \rho = \sin(\theta)$ has a singularity
% at $\rho = 0$. For this reason, differentiation in Diskfun is only done with 
% respect to the Cartesian coordinates, $x$ and $y$.
% </latex>
%%
% Here, we examine a  pair of harmonic conjugate functions, $u$ and $v$.
% We can use Diskfun to check that they satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann
% equations, and that $\nabla^2u = \nabla^2v = 0$. 
% Geometrically, this implies that the contour lines of $u$ and $v$
% intersect at right angles.
%%
u = diskfun(@(t,r) r.^3.*cos(3*t), 'polar');
v = diskfun(@(t,r) r.^3.*sin(3*t), 'polar');

norm(diffy(u) + diffx(v))                 % Check u_y =- v_x
norm(diffx(u) - diffy(v))                 % Check u_x = v_y

norm(lap(u)) 
norm(lap(v))                    
%%
contour(u, 20, 'b'), hold on
contour(v, 20, 'm'), axis off, hold off
title( 'Contour lines for u and v' )

% <latex>
% For the next example, we consider the eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator 
% in polar coordinates. As the analogue of the the spherical harmonics, they 
% are a natural basis for functions on the disk. 
% </latex> 
%%
% They can be accessed in Diskfun with the ```diskfun.harmonic``` command.
%%
% <latex>
% Here, we examine the 
% derivatives of the cylindrical harmonic function 
% $u = a J_4(\omega_{41}\rho) \cos(4 \theta)$. 
% The function $J_4$ is a Bessel function with parameter 4, $\omega_{41}$ is 
% the first positive root of $J_4$, and $a$ is a normalization constant 
% (see Ch. 9, [Churchill & Brown, 1978]). 
% We construct $u$ in Diskfun as follows:
% </latex>
%%
u = diskfun.harmonic(4, 1); 
plot(u), axis off
title('u')
%%
% Here are the first derivatives of $u$:   
%%
plot(diffx(u)), axis off
title('du/dx'), snapnow

%%
% <latex>
% Due to the rotational symmetry of $u$, $u_x$ is equivalent to
% the rotation of $u_y$ by an angle of $-\pi/2$ radians.
% </latex>
%%
norm(rotate(diffy(u), -pi/2)-diffx(u))
%%
% <latex>
% We observe that $u_{xx} + u_{yy}$ is a scalar multiple
% of $u$. We can compare Diskfun's result with the computation 
% $-\lambda u$, where $\sqrt{\lambda} = 7.58834243450380$.

lambda = (7.58834243450380)^2;
norm(-lambda*u - lap(u)) 
%% 16.3 Poisson equation
% <latex>
% We can use Diskfun to compute smooth solutions to the Poisson equation on 
% the disk. In this example, we compute the solution $v(\theta, \rho)$ 
% for the Poisson equation with a Dirichlet boundary condition: we seek $v$
% such that
% $$ \nabla^2 v = f, \qquad v(\theta, 1) = 1,$$
% where $(\theta, \rho) \in [-\pi, \pi] \times [0, 1]$ and
% $f = \sin \left( 21 \pi \left( 1 + \cos( \pi \rho)
% \right) \rho^2-2\rho^5\cos \left( 5(t-.11)\right) \right)$. The solution is
% returned as a diskfun, so we can immediately plot it, evaluate it, 
% find its zero contours, or perform other operations. Currently, Diskfun
% requires the user to specify the number of 2D
% coefficients to be solved for; in this case, we choose a coefficient matrix
% of size $256 \times 256$.   
% </latex>
%%
f = @(t,r) sin(21*pi*(1+cos(pi*r)).*(r.^2-2*r.^5.*cos(5*(t-0.11))));
rhs = diskfun(f, 'polar'); 
bc = @(t) 0*t+1;           
v = diskfun.poisson(f, bc, 256)

%% 16.4 Vector calculus
% Since the introduction of Chebfun2, Chebfun has supported computations with
% vector-valued functions, including functions in 2D (Chebfun2v), 3D
% (Chebfun3v), and spherical geometries (Spherefunv, Ballfunv). Similarly, Diskfunv
% allows one to compute with vector-valued functions on the disk.
% Currently, there are dozens of commands available in Diskfunv, including
% vector-based algebraic commands such as |cross|,
% as well as commands that map vector-valued functions to
% scalar-valued functions (e.g., |dot|, |curl|, |div| and |jacobian|)
% and vice-versa (e.g., |grad|), and commands for performing calculus
% with vector fields (e.g., |laplacian|).
%%
% In this example, we create a diskfun consisting of a difference of
% two Gaussian functions, and then compute its gradient. The result is 
% returned as a vector-valued object called a diskfunv, with a lower 
% case 'd'.
%%
psi = @(x,y) 5*exp(-10*(x+.2).^2-10*(y+.4).^2)...
    -5*exp(-10*(x-.2).^2-10*(y-.2).^2) + 5*(1-x.^2-y.^2)-20;
f = diskfun( psi ); 
u = grad(f)
%%
% <latex>
% The vector-valued function $\mathbf{u}$ consists of two components,
% ordered with respect to unit vectors in the directions of $x$ and $y$,
% respectively. Each of these is stored as a diskfun. We can view the vector
% field using a quiver plot:
% </latex>
%%
plot(f), hold on
quiver(u, 'k'), axis off, hold off
%%
% <latex>
% Once a diskfunv object is created, dozens of overloaded commands 
% can be applied to it. For example, here is a contour plot of the 
% divergence of $\mathbf{u}$.
% </latex>
%%
D = div( u );
contour(D,10), hold on
quiver(u, 'k'), axis off, hold off
%%
% <latex>
% Since $\mathbf{u}$ is the gradient of $f$, we can verify that
% $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = \nabla^2 f$:
% </latex>
%%
norm( div(u) - lap(f) )
%%
% <latex>
% Additionally, since $\mathbf{u}$ is a gradient field,
% $\nabla \times \mathbf{u} =  0$. 
% </latex>
%%
% We can verify this with the  |curl| command.
%%
v = curl(u);
norm( v )
%%
% <latex>
% Diskfunv objects can be created by calling the constructor directly 
% and supplying function handles or diskfuns for each component, 
% or by vertically concatenating two diskfuns. 
% Here, we demonstrate this by forming a diskfunv $\mathbf{v}$ that 
% represents the surface curl for a scalar-valued function $g$, 
% i.e, $\nabla \times [0, 0, g]$.
% </latex>
%%
g = diskfun( @(x,y) cosh(.25.*(cos(5*x)+sin(4*y.^2)))-2 );
dgx = diffx( g );
dgy = diffy( g );

v = diskfunv(dgy, -dgx);  % call constructor
norm(v - [dgy; -dgx])     % equivalent to vertical concatenation
%%
plot( g ), hold on
quiver(v, 'w'), axis off
title( 'The numerical surface curl of g' ), hold off
%%
% This construction is equivalent to using the command |curl|
% on the scalar function $g$:
%
norm( v - curl(g) )
%%
% To see all commands available for vector-valued functions in Diskfun, 
% type |methods diskfunv| in the MATLAB command line.
%% 16.5 Constructing a diskfun
% The above sections describe how to use Diskfun, and this section provides 
% a brief overview of how the algorithms in Diskfun work. This can be useful 
% for understanding various aspects of approximation involving functions 
% on the disk. More details can be found in [Townsend, Wilber & Wright, 2016b], 
% and also in the closely related Spherefun part (Chapter 17) of the guide.
%%
% Like Chebfun2 and Spherefun, Diskfun uses a variant of Gaussian
% elimination (GE) to form low rank approximations to functions. This often 
% results in a compressed representation of the function, and it also 
% facilitates the use of highly efficient algorithms that work primarily 
% on sets of 1D functions related to the approximant.
%%
% <latex>
% To construct a diskfun from a function $f$, we consider an extended version
% of $f$, denoted by $\tilde{f}$, which is formed by taking $f(\theta, \rho)$ 
% and letting $\rho$ range over $[-1, 1]$, as opposed to $[0, 1]$.
% This is the disk analogue of the so-called double Fourier sphere method 
% discussed in Chapter 17 (also, see [Fornberg, 1998] and [Trefethen, 2000]). 
% The function $\tilde{f}$ has a special structure, referred to as a block-
% mirror-centrosymmetric (BMC) structure.  By forming approximants that 
% preserve the BMC structure of $\tilde{f}$, smoothness near the origin is 
% guaranteed.  
% </latex>
%%
% To see the BMC structure, we construct a diskfun |f| and use 
% the |cart2pol| command:
%%
f = @(x,y) cos(2*((3*sin(2*x)+5*sin(y))))-.5*sin(x-y);
f = diskfun(f);
plot(f), axis off

% <latex>
% A structure-preserving method of GE (see [Townsend, Wilber & Wright, 2016b])
% adaptively selects a collection of 1D circular and radial
% "slices" that are used to approximate $\tilde{f}$. Each circular slice
% is a periodic function in $\theta$, and is represented by a trigonometric
% interpolant (or trigfun, see Chapter 11). Each radial slice, a function in
% $\rho$, is represented as a chebfun.  These slices form a low rank
% representation of $f$,
% \begin{equation} \label{eq:lra}
% f(\theta, \rho) \approx \sum_{j=1}^{n} d_jc_j(\rho)r_j(\theta),
% \end{equation}
% where $\{ d_j \}_{j=1}^{n}$ are pivot values associated with the GE
% procedure.
% </latex>
%%
% <latex>
% The |plot| command can be used to display the "skeleton" of |f|:
% the locations of the slices that were adaptively selected and sampled
% during the GE procedure. 
%%
% <latex> Comparing the skeleton to the tensor
% product grid required to approximate $\tilde{f}$ to machine precision, we
% see that $\tilde{f}$ is numerically of low rank, so Diskfun is effectively
% compressing the representation. The clustering of sample 
% points near the center and the edges of the disk can be observed in the
% tensor product grid; low rank methods alleviate this issue in
% many instances.

% Writing the approximant as in (\ref{eq:lra}) allows us to work with it as
% a continuous analogue of a matrix factorization. Then,
% the "column" (radial) slices of $f$ are the collection of Chebyshev 
% interpolants $c_j(\rho)$, and the "row" slices are the 
% trigonometric interpolants $r_j(\theta)$. These can be plotted; 
% doing so we observe that each column is either even or odd, and each row 
% is either $\pi$-periodic or $\pi$-antiperiodic. This is reflective of the 
% BMC structure inherent to the approximant.

% In practice, several basis choices can be used for approximation on the 
% disk (see [Boyd & Yu, 2011]). Diskfun uses the Chebyshev--Fourier basis, and 
% |f| is fully characterized by its Chebyshev and Fourier coefficients. The 
% command |plotcoeffs| lets us inspect these details.
