%% 8. Chebfun Preferences
% Lloyd N. Trefethen, November 2009, latest revision June 2019

%% 8.1  Introduction
% Like any software package, Chebfun is based on certain design
% decisions.  Some of these can be adjusted by the user, like the
% maximum number of points at which a function will be sampled before Chebfun
% gives up trying to resolve it.  Extensive information about
% these possibilities can be found by executing
% |help chebfunpref|, or for chebops, as used to solve
% integral and differential equations,
% |help cheboppref|.  To see the list of preferences and their current
% values, execute |chebfunpref| or |cheboppref|:
chebfunpref

%%
% More detailed information from further down in the
% preference structure will come from, for example,
% |help chebtech/techpref|.

%%
% To ensure that all preferences are set to their factory values, execute
chebfunpref.setDefaults('factory')

%%
% In this chapter we explore some of these adjustable
% preferences, showing how special effects can be achieved by modifying
% them.  Besides showing off some useful techniques, this review will also
% serve to deepen the user's understanding of Chebfun by poking
% around a bit at its edges.

%%
% A general point to be emphasized is the distinction between creating a
% chebfun directly from the constructor and creating one by operating on
% previous chebfuns.  In the former case we can include preferences
% directly in the constructor command, and we recommend this as good
% practice:
f = chebfun('x^x',[0,1],'splitting','on');

%%
% In the latter case, however, one can turn the preference on and
% off again.
x = chebfun('x',[0,1]);
chebfunpref.setDefaults('splitting',true) 
f = x^x;
chebfunpref.setDefaults('splitting',false) 

%% 8.2  |domain|: the default domain
% Like Chebyshev polynomials themselves, chebfuns are defined by default on
% the domain $[-1,1]$ if no other domain is specified.  However, this default
% choice of the default domain can be modified.  For example, we can work
% with trigonometric functions on $[0,2\pi]$ conveniently like this:
  chebfunpref.setDefaults('domain',[0 2*pi],'tech',@trigtech)
  f = chebfun(@(t) sin(19*t));
  g = chebfun(@(t) cos(20*t));
  plot(f,g), axis equal, axis off

%% 8.3 |splitting|: breaking into subintervals or not
% Perhaps the preference that users wish to control most often is the
% choice of splitting off or on.  Splitting off is the factory default.

%%
% In both splitting off and splitting on modes, a chebfun may consist of a
% number of pieces, called funs.  For example, even in splitting off mode,
% the following sequence makes a chebfun with four funs:
  chebfunpref.setDefaults('factory');
  x = chebfun(@(x) x);
  f = min(abs(x),exp(x)/6);
  format short, f.ends
  plot(f)

%%
% One breakpoint is introduced at $x=0$, where the constructor determines
% that $|x|$ has a zero, and two more breakpoints are introduced at
% $-0.1443$ and at $0.2045$, where it recognizes that
% $|x|$ and $\exp(x)/6$ will intersect.

%%
% The difference between splitting off and splitting on pertains to
% additional breakpoints that may be introduced in the more basic chebfun
% construction process, when the constructor makes a chebfun solely by
% sampling point values. For example, suppose we try to make the same
% chebfun as above from scratch, by sampling an anonymous function, in
% splitting off mode.  We get a warning message:
  ff = @(x) min(abs(x),exp(x)/6);
  f = chebfun(ff);

%%
% With splitting on, Chebfun's built-in edge detector quickly finds the
% singular points and introduces breakpoints there:
  f = chebfun(ff,'splitting','on');
  f.ends

%%
% This example involves specific points of singularity, which the
% constructor has duly located.  In addition to this, in splitting on mode
% the constructor will subdivide intervals recursively at non-singular
% points when convergence is not taking place fast enough.  For example,
% with splitting off we cannot successfully construct a chebfun for the
% square root function on $[0,1]$ (unless we use singular exponents as
% described in the next chapter):
  f = chebfun(@(x) sqrt(x),[0 1]);

%%
% With splitting on, however, all is well:
  f = chebfun(@(x) sqrt(x),[0 1],'splitting','on');
  length(f)
  format long, f((.1:.1:.5)'.^2)

%%
% Inspection reveals that Chebfun has broken the interval into a
% succession of pieces, each 100 times smaller than the next:
  f.ends

%%
% In this example the subdivisions have occurred near an
% endpoint, for the edge detector has determined that the difficulty of
% resolution lies there.  For other functions, however, splitting will take
% place at midpoints.  For example, here is a function that is complicated
% throughout $[-1,1]$, especially for larger values of $x$.
  ff = @(x) sin(x)*tanh(3*exp(x)*sin(15*x));

%%
% With splitting off, it gets resolved by a global polynomial of rather
% high degree.
  f = chebfun(ff);
  length(f)
  plot(f)

%%
% With splitting on, the function is broken up into pieces, and there is
% some reduction in the overall length:
  f = chebfun(ff,'splitting','on');
  length(f)
  format short, f.ends

%%
% When should one use splitting off, and when splitting on?  If the goal is
% simply to represent complicated functions, especially when they are more
% complicated in some regions than others, splitting on sometimes has
% advantages. An example is given by the function above posed on $[-3,3]$
% instead of $[-1,1]$. With splitting off, the global polynomial has a degree
% in the tens of thousands:
  f3 = chebfun(ff,[-3 3]);
  length(f3)
  plot(f3)

%%
% With splitting on the representation is much more compact:
  f3 = chebfun(ff,[-3 3],'splitting','on');
  length(f3)

%%
% On the other hand, splitting off mode has advantages of robustness.  In
% particular, operations involving derivatives generally work better when
% functions are represented by global polynomials, and chebops
% for the most part require this.  Also, for educational purposes, it is
% very convenient that Chebfun can be used so easily to study the
% properties of pure polynomial representations even of very high degree.

%% 8.4 |splitLength|: length limit in splitting on mode 
% When intervals are subdivided in splitting on mode, as just illustrated,
% the parameter |splitLength| determines where this will happen.  With the
% factory value |splitLength=160|, splitting will take place if a polynomial
% of length 160 proves insufficient to resolve a fun. (Actually, when Chebfun
% uses Chebyshev points of the second kind as it does by default, this number
% is rounded down to 1 more than a power of 2.)  Let us confirm for
% the chebfun |f| constructed a moment ago that the lengths of the individual
% funs are all less than or equal to 160 (actually 129):
  f.funs

%%
% Alternatively, suppose we wish to allow individual funs to have length up
% to 513.  We can do that like this:
  f = chebfun(ff,'splitting','on','splitLength',513);
  length(f)
  format short, f.ends
  f.funs

%% 8.5  |maxLength|: maximum length
% As just mentioned, in splitting off mode, the constructor tries to make a
% global chebfun from the given string or anonymous function.  For a
% function like $|x|$ or $\hbox{sign}(x)$, this will typically not be possible and
% we must give up somewhere. The parameter |maxLength|,
% set to $2^{16}+1$ in the
% factory, determines this giving-up point.

%%
% For example, here's what happens normally if we try to make a chebfun for
% $\hbox{sign}(x)$.
  f = chebfun('sign(x)');

%%
% Suppose we wish to examine the interpolant to this function through 65
% points instead of 65537.  One way is like this:
  f = chebfun('sign(x)',65);
  length(f)
  plot(f)

%%
% Notice that no warning message is produced since we have asked explicitly
% for exactly 65 points.  On the other hand we could also change the
% default maximum to this number, giving another short chebfun
% though now with another warning message:
  f = chebfun('sign(x)','maxLength',65);
  length(f)

%%
% Perhaps more often one might wish to adjust this preference to enable use
% of especially high degrees.  On the machines of 2019, Chebfun is
% perfectly capable of working with polynomials of degrees in the millions.
% The function $|x|^{5/4}$ on $[-1,1]$ provides an example, for it is
% smooth enough to be resolved by a global polynomial, provided it is of
% rather high degree:
  tic
  f = chebfun('abs(x)^1.25','maxLength',1e6);
  lengthf = length(f)
  format long, sumf = sum(f)
  plot(f)
  toc

%%
% (More efficient ways of resolving this function, by eliminating the
% singularity, are described in Chapter 9.)

%% 8.6 |minSamples|: minimum number of sample points
% At the other end of the spectrum, the preference |minSamples| determines the
% minimum number of points at which a function is sampled during the
% chebfun construction process, and the factory value of this parameter is
% 17.  This does not mean that all chebfuns have length at least 17.  For
% example, if $f$ is a cubic, then it will be sampled at 17 points, Chebyshev
% expansion coefficients will be computed, and 13 of these will be found to
% be of negligible size and discarded.  So the resulting chebfun is a
% cubic, even though the constructor never sampled at fewer than 17 points.
  f = chebfun('x^3');
  lengthf = length(f)

%%
% More generally a function is sampled at $17, 33, 65,\dots$ points until a set
% of Chebyshev coefficients are obtained with a tail judged to be negligible.

%% 
% Like any process based on sampling, this one can fail. For example, here
% is a success:
  f = chebfun('-x -x^2 + exp(-(30*(x-.47))^2)');
  length(f)
  plot(f)

%%
% But if we change the exponent to 4, we get a failure:
  f = chebfun('-x -x^2 + exp(-(30*(x-.47))^4)');
  length(f)
  plot(f)

%%
% What has happened can be explained as follows. The function being sampled
% has a narrow spike near $x=0.47$, and the closest grid points lie near
% $0.383$ and $0.556$.  In the case of the exponent 2, we note that at $x=0.383$
% and $x=0.556$,
% $\exp(-(30(x-.47)^2))$ takes values of about $0.001$, which are easily
% large enough to be noticed by the
% Chebfun constructor. On the other hand in the case of exponent 4, the
% values at these points shrink to less than $10^{-19}$, which 
% is below machine precision.  So in
% the latter case the constructor thinks it has a quadratic and does not
% try a finer grid.

%%
% If we increase |minSamples|, the correct chebfun is found:
  f = chebfun('-x -x^2 + exp(-(30*(x-.48))^4)','minSamples',33);
  length(f)
  plot(f)

%%
% Incidentally, if the value of |minSamples| specified is not one greater
% than a power of 2, it is rounded up to the next such value.
% Values less than 17 will be treated as if the value were 17.

%%
% The factory value |minSamples=17| was chosen as a compromise between
% efficiency and reliability.  (Until Version 5, the choice was
% |minSamples=9|.)  In practice it rarely seems to fail, but
% perhaps it is most vulnerable when applied in splitting on mode to
% functions with narrow spikes.  For example, the following chebfun is
% missing most of the spikes that should be there:
  ff = @(x) max(.85,sin(x+x^2)) - x/20;
  f = chebfun(ff,[0,10],'splitting','on');
  plot(f)

%%
% Increasing |minSamples| fills them in:
  f = chebfun(ff,[0,10],'splitting','on','minsamples',33);
  plot(f)
    
%% 8.7  |resampling|: exploiting nested grids or not
% We now turn to a particularly interesting preference for Chebfun geeks,
% relating to the very idea of what it means to sample a function.

%%
% When a chebfun is constructed, a function is normally sampled at $17,
% 33, 65,\dots$ Chebyshev points until convergence is achieved. (We are speaking
% here of the process for Chebyshev points of the second kind; for
% first-kind points the details are different.)  Now Chebyshev
% grids are nested, so the 33-point grid, for example, only contains 16
% points that are not in the 17-point grid.  By default, the Chebfun
% constructor takes advantage of this property so as not to recompute
% values that have already been computed.  (The default went the other way
% until 2009.)

%%
% For example, here is a chebfun constructed in the usual factory mode:
  ff = @(x) besselj(x,exp(x))
  tic, f = chebfun(ff,[0 8]); toc
  length(f)

%%
% There is little change if we set 'resampling on', so that previously
% computed values are not reused:
  tic, f = chebfun(ff,[0 8],'resampling','on'); toc 
  length(f)

%%
% One might wonder why 'resampling on' is an option at all, but in fact, it
% introduces some very interesting possibilities.  What if the "function"
% being sampled is not actually a fixed function, but depends on the grid?
% For example, consider this prescription:
  ff = @(x) length(x)*sin(15*x);

%%
% The values of $f$ at any particular point will depend on the length of the
% vector in which it is embedded! What will happen if we try to make a
% chebfun, disabling the "sampleTest" feature that is usually applied by
% the constructor as a safety test? The constructor tries the 17-point
% Chebyshev grid, then the 33-point grid, then the 65-point grid.  On the
% last of these it finds the Chebyshev coefficients are sufficiently small,
% and proceeds to truncate to length 44. We end up with a chebfun of length
% 44 that precisely matches the function $65\sin(15x)$.
f = chebfun(ff,'sampleTest',0,'resampling','on'); 
length(f)
max(f)
plot(f,'.-')

%%
% This rather bizarre example encourages us to play further. What if we
% change `length(x)*sin(15*x)` to `sin(length(x)*x)`? Now there is no
% convergence, for no matter how fine the grid is, the function is
% underresolved.
  hh = @(x) sin(length(x)*x);
  h = chebfun(hh,'sampleTest',0,'resampling','on');

%%
% Here is an in-between case where convergence is achieved on the grid of
% length 65, and the resulting chebfun then trimmed to length 46.
kk = @(x) sin(length(x)^(2/3)*x);    
k = chebfun(kk,'sampleTest',0,'resampling','on');
length(k)
plot(k,'.-')

%%
% Are such curious effects of any use?  Yes indeed, they are at the heart
% of Chebop.  When Chebfun solves an ODE boundary-value problem
% by a command like |u = L\f|, the chebfun |u| is
% determined by a "sampling" process in which a matrix problem obtained by
% Chebyshev spectral discretization is solved on grids of increasing sizes.
% The matrices change with the grids, so the sample values for $u$
% are crucially grid-dependent.  Without resampling, chebops would not
% work.

%% 8.8 |chebfuneps|: Chebfun constructor tolerance
% One of the controllable preferences is all too tempting: you can weaken
% the tolerance used in constructing a chebfun. The chebfunpref parameter
% |chebfuneps| is set by default to machine precision:
p = chebfunpref;
p.chebfuneps

%%
% However, one can change this with a command like
% |chebfunpref.setDefaults('chebfuneps',1e-6)|.
% Actually there is a simpler syntax:
chebfuneps('1e-4')
chebfuneps

%%
chebfuneps('factory')
chebfuneps

%%

% There are cases where weakening the tolerance makes a big
% difference. For example, this happens in certain applications in 2D and
% in certain applications involving differential equations.  (Indeed, the
% Chebfun differential equations commands have their own tolerance control
% strategies.) However, Chebfun does such a good job at resolving many
% functions that the |chebfuneps|-adjustment feature is not as useful as you
% might imagine, and we recommend that users not change |chebfuneps| unless
% they are having real problems with standard precision or are working with
% noisy data.  (In two or especially three dimensions, the balances change
% and there is more often a big benefit in weakending the tolerance; see
% section 8.11 below and chapter 18.)

%% 8.9 Chebyshev grids of first or second kind
% Beginning with Version 5, Chebfun includes capabilities for
% carrying out almost all computations with Chebyshev points of
% either the first kind ($\cos((j+1/2)\pi/(n+1)),$ $0\le j \le n$, implemented
% in the |chebtech1| class) or the
% second kind ($\cos(j\pi/n),$ $0\le j \le n$, implemented
% in the |chebtech2| class).
% These capabilities were included to further our research into
% the pros and cons of different kinds of algorithms, and 
% most users can ignore this choice entirely.  
% You can query which kind of Chebyshev points is in use with
t = chebkind

%%
% and you can set it with, for example,
chebkind(1)

%%
% or
chebkind 1

%%
% An equivalent would be the command
chebfunpref.setDefaults('tech',@chebtech1)

%%
% Let us return to factory settings:
chebfunpref.setDefaults('factory')

%% 8.10 Rectangular or ultraspherical spectral discretizations
% Chebfun's factory default for spectral discretizations is
% rectangular collocation in Chebyshev points of the second kind, which
% corresponds to 
cheboppref.setDefaults('discretization','chebcolloc2')

%%
% To change the preference to first-kind points, one can execute
cheboppref.setDefaults('discretization','chebcolloc1')

%%
% and for Olver-Townsend ultraspherical discretizations, as
% discussed in the last chapter,
cheboppref.setDefaults('discretization','ultraspherical')

%%
% Let us undo these changes:
cheboppref.setDefaults('factory')

%% 8.11 Chebfun2 preferences
% Chebfun2, for computing with functoins on a two-dimensional rectangle,
% is described in Chapter 12-15.
% A Chebfun2 preference that users may be particularly interested in
% is |MaxRank|, which determines the maximum rank of a low-rank
% approximation used to represent a function on a rectangle.
% The current factory default is 512, and this can be changed
% for example with
chebfunpref.setDefaults({'cheb2Prefs','maxRank'},1024);

%%
% For changing the Chebfun2 tolerance one can do this:
chebfun2eps = 1e-6;

%%
% Let us undo this change:
chebfunpref.setDefaults('factory')

%% 8.12 Additional preferences and further information
% Information about additional Chebfun preferences can be found by
% executing |chebfunpref| or |help chebfunpref|.  In general the most reliable
% values to use in setting preferences are
% are |1| or |true| and |0| or |false| (not |'on'| and |'off'|).

%%
% For example,
% |'sampleTest'| controls whether a function is evaluated at an extra point
% as a safety check of convergence.  With the default |'on'| value, this test
% is indeed carried out.

%%
% Another example is that
% |'blowup'| relates to the construction of chebfuns that diverge to
% infinity, as described in Chapter 9. |blowup=0| is used for no
% singularities, |blowup=1| if for functions with poles (blowups with a
% negative integer power) and |blowup=2| for functions with branch points
% (blowups with an arbitrary power).

%%

% Chebfun function construction process, see [1].
