%% 9. Infinite Intervals, Infinite Function Values, and Singularities
% Lloyd N. Trefethen, November 2009, latest revision June 2019

%%
% This chapter presents some features of
% Chebfun that are less robust than what is
% described in the first eight chapters.  With classic bounded
% chebfuns on a bounded interval $[a,b]$, you can do amazingly
% complicated things often without encountering any difficulties.
% Now we are going to let the intervals and the functions
% diverge to infinity --- but please
% lower your expectations!  These features are not always as accurate
% or reliable.

%% 9.1 Infinite intervals
% If a function converges reasonably rapidly to a constant at $\infty$,
% you can define a corresponding chebfun.  Here are a couple of
% examples on $[0,\infty)$.  First we plot a function and find its maximum:
f = chebfun('0.75 + sin(10*x)/exp(x)',[0 inf]);
MS = 'markersize';
plot(f)
maxf = max(f)

%%
% Next we plot another function and integrate it from $0$ to $\infty$:
g = chebfun('1/(gamma(x+1))',[0 inf]);
sumg = sum(g)
plot(g)

%%
% Where do $f$ and $g$ intersect?  We can find out using |roots|:
plot([f g])
r = roots(f-g)
hold on, plot(r,f(r),'.k',MS,12), hold off

%%
% Here's an example on $(-\infty,\infty)$ with a calculation of
% the location and value of the minimum:
g = chebfun(@(x) tanh(x-1),[-inf inf]);
g = abs(g-1/3);
plot(g)
[minval,minpos] = min(g)

%%
% Notice that a function on an infinite domain is by default plotted
% on an interval like $[0,10]$ or $[-10,10]$.  You can use an extra
% |'interval'| flag to plot
% on other intervals, as shown by this example of a function
% of small norm whose largest values are near $x=30$:
hh = @(x) cos(x)/(1e5+(x-30)^6);
h = chebfun(hh,[0 inf]);
plot(h,'interval',[0 100])
normh = norm(h)

%%
% Chebfun provides a convenient tool for the
% numerical evaluation of integrals over infinite domains:
g = chebfun('(2/sqrt(pi))*exp(-x^2)',[0 inf]);
sumg = sum(g)

%%
% The |cumsum| operator applied to this integrand gives us the error function,
% which matches the MATLAB |erf| function reasonably well:
errorfun = cumsum(g)
disp('          erf               errorfun')
for n = 1:6, disp([erf(n) errorfun(n)]), end

%%
% One should be cautious in evaluating integrals over infinite intervals,
% however, for as mentioned in Section 1.5, the accuracy
% is sometimes disappointing,
% especially for functions that do not decay very quickly:
sum(chebfun('(1/pi)/(1+s^2)',[-inf inf]))

%%
% Here's an example of a function whose wiggles decay too slowly to be
% fully resolved:
sinc = chebfun('sin(pi*x)/(pi*x)',[-inf inf]);
plot(sinc,'m','interval',[-10 10])

%%
% Chebfun's capability of handling infinite intervals was introduced
% originally by Rodrigo Platte in 2008-09.  The details of
% the implementation then changed
% considerably with the introduction of version 5 in 2014.

%%
% The use of mappings to transform an unbounded domain to a bounded one
% is an idea that has been employed many times
% over the years.  One of the references we have benefited especially from, which
% also contains pointers to other works in this area, is the book [Boyd 2001].

%% 9.2 Poles
% Chebfun can handle certain "vertical" as well as
% "horizontal" infinities --- especially, functions that blow up according
% to an integer power, i.e., with a pole.  If you know the nature of the blowup,
% it is a good idea to specify it using the |'exps'| flag.
% For example, here's a function with a simple pole at $0$.  We use
% |'exps'| to tell the constructor that the function looks like $x^{-1}$
% at the left endpoint and $x^0$ (i.e., smooth) at the right
% endpoint.
f = chebfun('sin(50*x) + 1/x',[0 4],'exps',[-1,0]);
plot(f), ylim([-5 30])

%%
% Here's the same function but over a domain that contains the
% singularity in the middle.  We tell the constructor where the
% pole is and what the singularity looks like:
f = chebfun('sin(50*x) + 1/x',[-2 0 4],'exps',[0,-1,0]);
plot(f), ylim([-30 30])

%%
% Here's the tangent function:
f = chebfun('tan(x)', pi*((-5/2):(5/2)), 'exps', -ones(1,6));
plot(f), ylim([-5 5])

%%
% Rootfinding works as expected:
x2 = chebfun('x/2',pi*(5/2)*[-1 1]);
hold on, plot(x2,'k')
r = roots(f-x2,'nojump');
plot(r,x2(r),'or',MS,8), hold off

%%
% And we can manipulate the function in various other familiar ways:
g = sin(2*x2)+min(abs(f+2),6);
plot(g)

%%
% If you don't know what singularities your function may
% have, Chebfun has some ability to find them if the flags
% |'blowup|' and |'splitting|' are on:
gam = chebfun('gamma(x)',[-4 4],'splitting','on','blowup',1);
plot(gam), ylim([-10 10])

%%
% But it's always better to specify the breakpoints and powers if you know them:
gam = chebfun('gamma(x)',[-4:0 4],'exps',[-1 -1 -1 -1 -1 0]);

%%
% This is essentially the same result you will get if you execute
% |plot(cheb.gallery('gamma'))|.

%%
% Can you explain the following three results?
sum(gam)

%%
sum(abs(gam))

%%
sum(abs(gam)^.9)

%%
% It's also possible to have poles of different strengths
% on two sides of a singularity.  In this case, you specify two
% exponents at each internal breakpoint rather than one:
f = chebfun(@(x) cos(100*x)+sin(x)^(-2+sign(x)),[-1 0 1],'exps',[0 -3 -1 0]);
plot(f), ylim([-30 30])


%% 9.3  Singularities other than poles
% Less reliable but also sometimes useful is the possibility of working
% with functions with algebraic singularities that are not poles.
% Here's a function with inverse square root singularities at each end:
w = chebfun('(2/pi)/(sqrt(1-x^2))','exps',[-.5 -.5]);
plot(w,'m'), ylim([0 10])

%%
% The integral is $2$:
sum(w)

%%
% We pick this example because
% Chebyshev polynomials are the orthogonal polynomials with respect
% to this weight function, and Chebyshev coefficients are defined by
% inner products against Chebyshev polynomials with respect to this
% weight.  For example, here we compute inner products of $x^4 + x^5$
% against the Chebyshev polynomials $T_0,\dots,T_5$.  (The integrals
% in these inner products
% are calculated by Gauss-Jacobi quadrature using methods due
% to Hale and Townsend; for more on this subject see the command |jacpts|.)
x = chebfun('x');
T = chebpoly(0:5)';
f = x^4 + x^5;
chebcoeffs1 = T*(w.*f)

%%
% Here for comparison are the Chebyshev coefficients as obtained
% from |chebcoeffs|:
chebcoeffs2 = chebcoeffs(f)

%%
% Notice the excellent agreement except for coefficient $a_0$.
% As mentioned in Section 4.1, in this special case
% the result from the inner product must be multiplied by $1/2$.

%% 
% You can specify singularities for functions that don't blow up, too.
% For example, suppose we want to work with $(x\exp(x))^{1/2}$ on the interval
% $[0,2]$.  A first try fails completely:
ff = @(x) sqrt(x*exp(x));
d = [0,2];
f = chebfun(ff,d)

%%
% We could turn splitting on and resolve the function by many
% pieces, as illustrated in Section 8.3:
f = chebfun(ff,d,'splitting','on')

%%
% A better representation, however, is constructed if we
% tell Chebfun about the singularity at $x=0$:
f = chebfun(ff,d,'exps',[.5 0])
plot(f)

%%
% Under certain circumstances Chebfun will introduce singularities
% like this of its own accord.  For example, just as |abs(f)| introduces
% breakpoints at roots of |f|, |sqrt(abs(f))| introduces breakpoints and
% also singularities at such roots:
theta = chebfun('t',[0,4*pi]);
f = sqrt(abs(sin(theta)))
plot(f)
sumf = sum(f)

%%
% If you have a function that blows up but you don't know the
% nature of the singularities, even whether they are poles or
% not, Chebfun will try to figure them
% out automatically if you run in |'blowup 2'| mode.  Here's an example
f = chebfun('x*(1+x)^(-exp(1))*(1-x)^(-pi)','blowup',2)

%%
% Notice that the |'exps'| field shows values close
% to $-e$ and $-\pi$, as is confirmed by looking
% at the numbers to higher precision:
get(f, 'exps')

%%
% The treatment of blowups in Chebfun
% was initiated by Mark Richardson in an MSc thesis at
% Oxford [Richardson 2009], then further developed by
% Richardson in collaboration with Rodrigo Platte and Nick Hale,
% then developed again by Kuan Xu and others in
% the creation of Chebfun version 5.

%% 9.4 Another approach to singularities
% Chebfun version 4 offered an alternative |singmap| approach to singularities
% based on mappings of the $x$ variable.   This is no longer available
% in version 5.
