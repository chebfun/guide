%% 10. Nonlinear ODEs, IVPs, and Chebgui
% Lloyd N. Trefethen, November 2009, latest revision June 2019

%%
% Chapter 7 described Chebfun's |chebop| capabilities
% for solving linear ordinary
% differential equations by the backslash command.  We will now describe
% extensions of chebops to nonlinear problems, as well as special
% methods used for ODE initial-value problems (IVPs) as opposed to
% boundary-value problems (BVPs).  Most of the design and
% implementation of these features was done by Asgeir Birkisson in
% collaboration with Toby Driscoll.
% For many examples and a variety of further information,

%% 10.1  Boundary-value problems: \ and |solvebvp|
% Chebfun contains overloads |bvp4c| and |bvp5c| of MATLAB codes
% of the same names.  However, these are not our recommended methods
% for solving BVPs, and we will not discuss them here.
% Instead, we present methods based on \ and its equivalent
% command |solvebvp|.

%%
% Recall that in Chapter 7, we realized linear
% operators as chebops constructed by commands like these:
L = chebop(-1, 1);
L.op = @(x,u) 0.0001*diff(u,2) + x*u;

%%
% Using such an object we can solve the BVP
% $$ 0.0001 u'' + xu = e^x, \qquad u(-1) = 0, ~~ u(1) = 1 $$
% as follows:
L.lbc = 0; L.rbc = 1;
x = chebfun('x');
u = L\exp(x);
plot(u), grid on, ylim([-50 50])

%%
% What's going on in such a calculation is that |L| is a prescription for
% constructing matrices of arbitrary dimensions which are Chebyshev spectral
% approximations to the differential operator.
% When backslash is executed, the
% problem is solved on successively finer grids until convergence is achieved.

%%
% The object |L| is a chebop:
L

%%
% Notice that Chebfun has detected that the chebop is linear.
% Doing this automatically is not a triviality! --- see
% [Birkisson & Driscoll 2013].

%%
% The same approach also works for nonlinear problems.
% For example, 
% in Section 7.9 we hand-coded a Newton iteration to solve the nonlinear
% BVP
% $$ 0.001u''-u^3 = 0,\qquad  u(-1) = 1,~~ u(1) = -1. $$
% Chebfun solves such problems automatically in response
% to the same syntax as above.
% Switching from |L| to |N| to suggest nonlinearity, let us write
N = chebop(@(x,u) 0.001*diff(u,2) - u^3);
N.lbc = 1; N.rbc = -1;
%%
% This gives us a chebop which Chebfun recognizes as nonlinear,
N
%%
% To solve the BVP, we can write
u = N\0;
plot(u), grid on

%%
% Note that this is the same result as in Section 7.9.
% How does Chebfun solve such problems?  That is a long story, which we shall
% not tell properly here.  In brief,
% a Newton iteration (sometimes a damped Newton iteration) 
% is carried out in "continuous mode", that is,
% in a space of functions rather than vectors.  Recall that to find a zero
% of a scalar function, Newton's method requires a
% derivative at each iterative step,
% and to find a zero vector of a system of equations, it
% requires a Jacobian matrix.  Here, we seek
% a zero function of a nonlinear differential operator
% equation.  For this, Newton's method requires at each step the
% continuous analogue of a Jacobian matrix, which is a 
% Frechet derivative linear operator.  This Frechet
% derivative is realized in Chebfun by a
% continuous analogue of Automatic Differentiation using
% methods described in [Birkisson & Driscoll 2012].

%%
% Here is an example with a variable coefficient, a nonlinear BVP
% due to George Carrier analyzed in Sec. 9.7 of the book
% [Bender & Orzsag 1978].  We seek a function $u$ satisfying
% $$ \varepsilon u'' + 2(1-x^2) u + u^2 = 1, \qquad u(-1)=u(1) = 0 $$
% with $\varepsilon = 0.01$.  Here is a Chebfun formulation
% and solution.
ep = 0.01;
N = chebop(-1, 1);
N.op = @(x,u) ep*diff(u,2) + 2*(1 - x^2)*u + u^2;
N.bc = 'dirichlet';
u = N\1; plot(u), ylim([-2 2]), grid on

%%
% This is one of several valid solutions to this problem.
% To find another, we can specify a initial guess for the Newton
% iteration that differs from Chebfun's default (a polynomial
% function constructed to satisfy the boundary conditions --- the
% zero function in this case).
% For example, here we specify the
% initial guess $u(x) = 2(x^2 - 1)(1 - 2/(1 + 20x^2))$ and get
% a solution with two peaks instead of four.
x = chebfun('x');
N.init = 2*(x^2 - 1)*(1 - 2/(1 + 20*x^2));
[u, info] = solvebvp(N, 1);
plot(u), grid on

%%
% This time, instead of using |\|, we called the underlying method
% |solvebvp|, and we specified two
% output arguments.  The second output is
% a MATLAB struct containing data showing the norms of the
% updates during the Newton iteration, revealing a slow
% initial phase followed by eventual rapid convergence.
nrmdu = info.normDelta;
semilogy(nrmdu,'.-k'), grid on, ylim([1e-14,1e2])

%%
% Another way to get information about the Newton iteration with nonlinear
% backlash is by setting
cheboppref.setDefaults('plotting','on')

%%
% or
cheboppref.setDefaults('display','iter')

%%
% Type |help cheboppref| for details.  Here we shall not pursue this option
% and thus return the system to its factory state:
cheboppref.setDefaults('factory')

%%
% When you apply
% backslash to a nonlinear chebop, it invokes the overloaded MATLAB command
% |mldivide|; this in turn calls |solvebvp| to do the actual work. By
% calling |solvebvp| directly, you can control the computation in ways not
% accessible through backslash, a situation just like the relationship
% between |\| and |linsolve| for solving a linear system in MATLAB.
% See the help documentation for details.

%% 10.2  Initial-value problems: \ and |solveivp|
% For IVPs, Chebfun contains overloads |ode113|, |ode45|, and |ode15s| of
% familiar MATLAB codes.  Again, however, these are
% not our recommended methods.
% Instead, we recommend \ and its equivalent |solveivp|.

%%
% For example, suppose we want to solve the nonlinear IVP
% $$ u' = u^2, \qquad t\in [0,1], \quad u(0)=0.95.  $$
% We can set up the problem like this:
N = chebop(0, 1);
N.op = @(t,u) diff(u) - u^2;  
N.lbc = 0.95

%%
% Since boundary conditions have been specified at only
% one end of the domain, Chebfun knows that this is an
% initial value problem.  We solve it and plot the
% solution:
u = N\0;                 
plot(u), grid on

%%
% A major change was introduced in Version 5.1 in how
% initial-value (and final-value) problems are solved.
% Before, Chebfun used the same global spectral representations
% as for BVPs.  This usually works fine for linear problems, but for
% nonlinear ones, it is inferior to the
% method of time-stepping by Runge-Kutta or Adams formulas.
% In Chebfun Version 5.1,
% we accordingly switched to solving IVPs numerically by
% |ode113| (by default), converting the resulting output to
% a Chebfun representation.  (This work, a substantial job since
% higher-order equations must be reformulated as first-order
% systems, was
% carried out by Asgeir Birkisson [Brikisson 2018].)
% If you wish to invoke the global
% spectral method instead of time-stepping, you can write
u2 = solvebvp(N,0);

%%
% (With |cheboppref.setDefaults('ivpSolver','collocation')| you
% could make this switch globally.)
% For this problem the method converges, giving a
% solution that is close but not the same:
norm(u-u2)

%% 
% For many nonlinear IVPs, however, the |solvebvp| approach
% would not converge.

%%
% Here is an example of an IVP with two components; the
% equation happens to be linear.
N = chebop(0, 100);
N.op = @(t,u) diff(u,2) + u;
N.lbc = [1; 0];
u = N\0;
plot([u diff(u)]), grid on, ylim([-1.5 1.5])

%%
% As a third example, let us solve a van der Pol equation
% for a nonlinear oscillator,  
% $$ \varepsilon u'' = (1-u^2)u' - u , \qquad t\in [0,20],
% ~~ u(0) = 3, ~~u'(0) = 0. $$
% Here is a solution with $\varepsilon = 0.05$:
N = chebop(0,20);
N.op = @(t,u) 0.05*diff(u,2) - (1-u^2)*diff(u) + u;
N.lbc = [3; 0];
u = N\0;
plot(u), ylim([-4 4]), grid on

%%
% As a final example let us consider the famous Lorenz
% equations, whose solution trajectories are chaotic:
% We can set up the problem and solve it like this:
N = chebop(0,15);
N.op = @(t,u,v,w) [diff(u)-10*(v-u);
                   diff(v)-u*(28-w)+v;
                   diff(w)-u*v+(8/3)*w];
N.lbc = @(u,v,w) [u+14; v+15; w-20];
[u,v,w] = N\0;
plot3(u,v,w), view(-5,9), axis off

%% 10.3 Stiff IVPs
% Chebfun's default solution methods work well for
% moderately stiff ODE IVPs.  For highly stiff problems, 
% however, it is desirable to switch the underlying engine
% from the default |ode113| to the stiff solver |ode15s|.  For
% example, the problem
% $$ u' = -u - 10000(u(t)-\cos(t)), \qquad u(0) = 1 $$
% has the solution $u(t) = \cos(t)$.  However, it is highly
% stiff, and to solve it we can proceed as follows:
N = chebop(0, 10);
N.op = @(t,u) diff(u) + sin(t) + 10000*(u-cos(t));
N.lbc = 1;
pref = cheboppref; pref.ivpSolver = 'ode15s';
tic, u = solveivp(N,0,pref); toc
plot(u), grid on, ylim([-1.5 1.5])

%%
% If we don't specify |ode15s|, the solution takes minutes
% instead of seconds.

%% 10.4 Periodic problems
% A relatively new feature in Chebfun is the solution of periodic ODEs;
% see chapter 19 of [Trefethen, Birkisson & Driscoll 2018].
% For example, here is a function encoded in the |gallerytrig| command:
plot(cheb.gallerytrig('tsunami'), 'color', [.6 .4 0]), grid on
ylim([-.2 .2])

%%
% If you look in |gallerytrig|, you will find that this curve has
% been generated by the following sequence:
op = @(x,u) diff(u,2) + diff(u) + 600*(1+sin(x))*u;
L = chebop(op, [-pi,pi], 'periodic');
f = L\1;

%%
% which corresponds to the problem
% $$ u'' + u' + 600(1+\sin(x)) = 0, \quad x\in [-\pi,\pi], 
% ~~ u(-\pi)=u(\pi), ~~ u'(-\pi)=u'(\pi) . $$
% The |periodic| flag instructs Chebfun to impose periodic boundary
% conditions and solve the problem with a trigonometric discretization,
% that is, a Fourier spectral method.
% The result is a trigfun:
f

%% 10.5 Ultraspherical discretizations
% As with most Chebfun operations involving differential equations,
% for nonlinear ODE BVPs and periodic ODEs Chebfun offers a choice
% between the default spectral collocation methods or an alternative
% ultraspherical method.  See Sections 7.7 and 8.10.

%% 10.6 Graphical user interface: Chebgui
% Chebfun includes a GUI (Graphical User Interface) called
% |chebgui| for interactive
% solution of ODE, time-dependent PDE, and eigenvalue problems.  For
% many users, this is the single most important part of Chebfun.
% We will not describe |chebgui| here, but we encourage readers
% to give it a try.
% Be sure to note the |Demo| menu, which offers
% dozens of preloaded examples,
% both scalars and systems. Perhaps most important of all is the "Export to
% m-file" button, which produces a Chebfun m-file corresponding to whatever
% problem is loaded into the GUI.  This feature enables one to get going quickly
% and interactively, then switch to a Chebfun program to adjust the fine points.
% To start exploring, just type |chebgui|.
